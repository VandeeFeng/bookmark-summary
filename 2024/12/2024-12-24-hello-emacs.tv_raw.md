December 23, 2024A few days ago, [Sacha Chua](https://sachachua.com/blog/) mentioned how [cool it would be to have an Emacs video index](https://social.sachachua.com/@sacha/statuses/01JF94JQQNNRXMTKN3Y1774TFP) like [Ruby Video](https://www.rubyvideo.dev/topics). I mentioned how I had similarly considered a low-tech solution, maybe powered by plain text (bonus points for [org mode](https://orgmode.org/) of course).

A little later, Sacha [shared a preliminary video feed dump](https://social.sachachua.com/@sacha/statuses/01JFG5T3C6E88362DRDZN9ANA6), in org! With that, I wrote the [first experiment to render the org feed](https://indieweb.social/@xenodium/113682069315989397) and [emacs.tv](https://emacs.tv/) was born.

[emacs.tv](https://emacs.tv/) is merely a few days old. Powered by an org feed (rendered client-side), but we can fetch and render in all sorts of ways. [emacs.tv](https://emacs.tv/) brings it to the web, though I'm sure we can come up with all sorts of Emacs integrations. A new major mode? Or maybe convert the org feed to rss and plug into [elfeed](https://github.com/skeeto/elfeed)?

This is what a feed entry looks like:

As mentioned, this is a new project. It's a good start, but it can only get better with your help.

### Submit more content

Sacha kickstarted a [wonderful video feed,](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/emacstv/emacstv.github.io/refs/heads/main/videos.org) a collection of 1715 videos as of today. We need more. Are your published videos missing? Reckon other videos should be listed? Please help by [submitting](https://github.com/emacstv/emacstv.github.io#add-videos) new entries.

### Improve our tagging

Many of the listed videos could use more tags. Please help us by tagging content in [video.org](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/emacstv/emacstv.github.io/refs/heads/main/videos.org) and submit a [pull request](https://github.com/emacstv/emacstv.github.io/pulls).
