    Roland Meertens and Anthony Alford discuss the historical cycles of AI "summers" and "winters": periods of optimism and decline in AI research. The conversation follows the story of neural networks, to the resurgence of AI with backpropagation and deep learning in the 2010s. They also explore the potential for a future "AI Winter", as technological advances face both hype and skepticism.
