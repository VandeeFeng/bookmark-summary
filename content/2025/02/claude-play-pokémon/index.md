## Summary
**摘要**：
Anthropic的研究人员进行了一项有趣的实验，让AI模型Claude玩宝可梦游戏。最初，Claude 3.5 Sonnet在2024年6月表现不佳，无法有效地进行游戏，甚至试图逃避强制战斗。尽管如此，还是有一些有趣的时刻，比如Claude卡在角落，并正式请求重置游戏。到了10月份，改进后的Claude 3.5 Sonnet取得了一些进展，但仍然无法成为宝可梦大师。然而，最新的Claude 3.7 Sonnet表现出色，在几天内击败了游戏中的重要角色。Claude之所以能够做到这一点，是因为它配备了知识库来存储笔记，视觉来观察屏幕，以及模拟按钮操作的功能调用。这些工具使Claude能够进行数万次的互动，并在游戏中进行规划、记住目标并在策略失败时进行调整。这个实验展示了AI系统在解决问题时，可以通过泛化的推理能力来不断提高其能力。

**要点总结**：

1.  **实验背景与目标**：Anthropic的研究人员让AI模型Claude尝试玩宝可梦游戏，旨在探索AI在解决复杂任务中的推理和学习能力，这是一个研究人员的个人项目，目的是观察Claude在游戏中的表现，测试其解决问题的能力。

2.  **早期模型的局限性**：最初的Claude 3.5 Sonnet模型在游戏中表现不佳，无法有效推进游戏进程，甚至出现卡顿和逃避战斗的情况，表明早期版本的AI在复杂游戏环境中缺乏足够的策略规划和适应能力。

3.  **新模型的显著进步**：最新的Claude 3.7 Sonnet模型在游戏中取得了显著进展，能够击败游戏中的重要角色，这归功于其扩展的思考能力，允许模型进行更深入的规划和更有效的策略调整。

4.  **实现进步的关键因素**：Claude能够成功玩宝可梦的关键在于它所配备的工具，包括知识库（用于存储笔记）、视觉功能（用于观察屏幕）和功能调用（用于模拟按钮操作），这些工具共同作用，使Claude能够持续进行游戏并进行有效交互。

5.  ** generalized reasoning（泛化推理）的应用**：通过这个实验，我们看到了AI系统在解决挑战时，不仅仅依赖于训练，还能够通过泛化的推理能力来不断提高其能力，这为AI在更广泛领域的应用带来了希望，意味着AI可以通过学习和适应来解决新的、未曾预料到的问题。

A few researchers at Anthropic have, over the past year, had a part-time obsession with a peculiar problem.

Can Claude play Pokémon?

A thread:

Early attempts were poor. In June 2024, Claude 3.5 Sonnet struggled to progress. When challenged, it repeatedly tried to run from mandatory battles.

This wasn't surprising: Claude has never been explicitly trained to play any video games.

These early attempts were not without moments of levity too.

On one occasion, Claude got stuck in a corner and—convinced something must be broken—typed out a formal request to reset the game.

With the new Claude 3.5 Sonnet in October, there was a glimmer of improvement. Claude managed to beat a rival for the first time and move beyond Pallet Town.

But ultimately, progress stalled. Better, yes, but far from becoming a Pokémon master.

Last week, a researcher tried out an early preview of Claude 3.7 Sonnet.

The results were striking. Within hours, Claude defeated Brock. Days later, it trounced Misty. Progress that older models had little hope of achieving.

Turns out extended thinking is super effective.

Where previous models wandered aimlessly or got stuck in loops, Claude 3.7 Sonnet plans ahead, remembers its objectives, and adapts when initial strategies fail.

Critical skills for battling pixelated gym leaders. And, we posit, in solving real-world problems too.

So, what makes this possible? Claude was given a knowledge base to store notes, vision to see the screen, and function calls which allow it to simulate button presses and navigate the game.

Together, they allow Claude to sustain gameplay with tens of thousands of interactions.

With a few tools to help it see the screen a bit better, Claude acts as an agent, applying its abilities to a novel task.

In this, we start to see glimmers of AI systems that tackle challenges with increasing competence, not just through training but with generalized reasoning.

A small but enthusiastic following has formed at Anthropic, checking in on Claude's progress.

Claude provides its followers daily moments of delight, like deciding to misname its Squirtle, "TSUNMAI!"

Claude Plays Pokémon continues on as a researcher's personal project.

And for those curious about Claude's improved reasoning capabilities, we go into even more detail in this thread:

Some things come to us nearly instantly. Others take much more mental stamina. We can choose to apply more or less cognitive effort depending on the task at hand.

Now, Claude has that same flexibility.
