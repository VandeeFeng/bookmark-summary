## Summary
**摘要**:
本文反思博客写作的价值和意义,在讨论了诸多写作其他人的反馈缺乏、受众未达到期待的问题之后,作者采用了与street photography相似的例子,强调了写作的目的更多在于创作者个人的思考、观察和表达,而不是他人对作品的反馈。关键在于,不论是写作亦或摄影,作都者应秉持对于个人兴趣和创造过程的追求,而不仅仅追求结果的表现。

**要点总结**:
- **不受重视的写作**:作者从Bill Bernbach的名言出发,提及写作往往伴随着孕育一个没有后果的过程,强调了博客文章的验证——通常缺乏真实读者和互动。
- **撰写与初衷**:认识到写作是在一个可能无法被听见的世界里自我表达和思考的过程,作者提出了实际的努力目的是为了满足作者自身的思想和视角的清晰化。
- **思考和创造力促进**:撰写能够帮助思考更加清晰和深刻,随后产生的作品也更为优秀,强调了个人成长和作品价值无关数量而在于质量。
- **潜在读者**:尽管潜在读者可能很小,甚至是隐形的,强调了博客写作中的多个潜在读者群,包括未来的自己,某一天寻求帮助的灵魂,以及作品本身与作者的个人成长之间的关系。
- **创作的生命与满足**:即使写作之后没有直接的阅读反馈,完成创作本身就是一场胜利。作者通过与街拍活动的类比强调了创作的价值在于过程本身,而不仅仅是外界的认同。

Back in the day, advertising legend Bill Bernbach said, “The most powerful element in advertising is the truth.”

Let’s tell the truth, then: Nobody reads your blog.

At least, not as many as you’d like. Maybe a handful, maybe none. You pour your thoughts into it, craft each sentence, pick the right image — then silence. No likes, no shares, no engagement.

So what’s the point?

There’s two lies we tell ourselves:

1.  _If I write it, they will come._ They won’t. There are billions of blog posts out there. The internet is an infinite void, and your blog is a whisper in a hurricane.
2.  If nobody reads it, it’s a waste of time.

Is it, though?

There is a hidden value in blogging. There’s an old Zen saying: “Chop wood, carry water.” You do it not for the applause but because it needs doing.

Blogging forces clarity. It makes you structure your thoughts, sharpen your perspective. You stop writing fluff because — let’s be honest — you’re writing for yourself. And if you can’t keep yourself interested, nobody else stands a chance.

When you write, you think better. When you think better, you create better.

So, who’s there real audience?

You’re not just writing for today’s invisible audience. You’re writing for:

*   Future you. Your posts become a time capsule of your evolving mind.
*   One right person. Maybe one day, someone stumbles across your words at exactly the right moment. And that changes something for them.
*   The work itself. Consistency beats virality. A hundred posts with depth will outlast a single viral hit.

And there’s another thing. My other passion is street photography. Which is a bit like blogging.

You walk through the city, camera in hand. You see a scene — a moment of light, shadow, humanity. You capture it.

Nobody cares.

But that’s not why you did it. You did it because you saw something.

Like blogging. You write because you think, because you observe, because you need to put it somewhere.

If someone reads it? Bonus. If not? The work still got done.

And that’s the real point.
