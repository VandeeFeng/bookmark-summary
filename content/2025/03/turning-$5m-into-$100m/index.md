## Summary
**摘要**：
风险投资中，构建投资组合需要在风险、回报和信念之间找到平衡。文章作者所在的Collaborative Fund在2015年大胆尝试，将2500万美元基金的20%（即500万美元）投入一家初创公司，并在五年内获得了超过1亿美元的回报，使整个基金翻了两番。文章探讨了风险投资组合构建背后的数学原理，集中投资和分散投资之间的权衡，以及高回报往往来自高信念的投资。文章分析了凯利判据、概率驱动方法和蒙特卡洛模拟等常见的投资组合构建方法，指出了它们在风险投资中的局限性。这些模型都无法完美捕捉风险投资的现实，但可以提供大致的方向。早期基金的目标是进行25-40项投资，以平衡捕捉突破性赢家的可能性和避免过度稀释。投资组合构建不仅仅是数学，也是一种策略。文章还讨论了减少集中度和增加集中度的策略性原因，包括公司寿命、领导地位、质量与数量等。最终，风险投资既是科学也是艺术，真正的挑战在于知道何时承担集中的风险，并有自律性地接受结果。

**要点总结**：

1.  **风险投资回报的幂律分布**：风险投资的回报遵循幂律分布，少数投资产生大部分回报。构建投资组合的关键在于抓住这些突破性机会，同时避免过度分散投资。这意味着需要在少量高潜力项目上集中投资，而不是在大量项目上平均分配资金。

2.  **风险投资组合构建的数学模型局限性**：文章评估了几种常见的投资组合构建方法，包括凯利判据、概率驱动方法和蒙特卡洛模拟，但没有一种模型能够完美适用于风险投资。这些模型通常基于不确定性假设，无法准确预测初创公司的成功率和退出价值。尽管如此，这些模型可以为投资组合构建提供参考，帮助确定大致的投资范围和规模。

3.  **集中投资与分散投资的权衡**：集中投资可以带来更高的回报，但也伴随着更高的风险。分散投资虽然可能降低回报，但可以提高投资组合的整体稳定性。选择哪种策略取决于基金的风险承受能力、投资期限和对特定项目的信心。文章强调，过分集中的基金如果失败可能会影响未来的融资。

4.  **信念在投资决策中的作用**：文章强调，投资决策应该基于对团队、市场和早期进展的坚定信念。当一家基金对某个项目有高度信心时，应该考虑进行集中投资，即将更大比例的资金投入该项目。然而，文章也提醒，高风险高回报，如果投资失败，需要重新评估投资策略。

5.  **风险投资的艺术性与科学性**：风险投资不仅仅是数学和模型，也是一种艺术。成功的风险投资需要对市场趋势、技术创新和团队能力有深刻的理解。文章总结到，真正的挑战在于知道何时承担集中的风险，并有自律性地接受结果。

Turning $5M Into $100M
----------------------

Balancing risk, reward, and conviction in venture capital portfolio construction.

In 2015, Collaborative Fund made an unusually bold bet—investing $5 million—20% of a $25 million fund—into a single startup. Less than five years later, that one investment returned over $100 million, singlehandedly quadrupling the entire fund.

Was this risk justified? Should a fund spread $25 million across twenty-five $1 million bets or five $5 million ones?

This wasn’t only a lucky outcome; it was also a deliberate choice rooted in conviction. Venture capital returns famously follow a power law—a tiny fraction of investments often generate the majority of returns, both for a given fund and the entire industry each year. The challenge is structuring a portfolio to catch at least one of these breakout outcomes without over-diversifying and diluting returns.

This post examines the math behind portfolio construction, the trade-offs between concentration and diversification, and why exceptional outcomes often come from high-conviction positions.

### The flawed math behind venture portfolio construction

Venture investing is often called an art, but that doesn’t stop people from trying to turn it into a science. Many funds use math to guide portfolio construction, helping to estimate how many bets to place and how much to allocate per investment in a given fund. These range from probability-driven frameworks like the Kelly Criterion to simulation-based modeling like Monte Carlo.

No model perfectly captures the reality of venture capital. Each has flaws, assumptions, and blind spots. Some fail to account for the extreme variance in startup outcomes, while others assume investors can accurately predict success rates—something historical data suggests is extraordinarily difficult.

Still, these frameworks can help ballpark an approach. Below are some of the more common ones and their limitations.

**Kelly criterion**

Originally developed for gamblers, the [Kelly Criterion](https://medium.com/@nicola-weiroster/vc-portfolio-size-a-kelly-criterion-approach-2f18791a2832) calculates the optimal bet size to maximize long-term returns. In VC, it can be used to help determine the proportion of a fund to allocate per startup.

_Why it isn’t a perfect fit for VC_:

*   You don’t know exact probabilities of success or payouts—Kelly assumes you do.
*   It assumes you can reinvest winnings each round, but in VC, capital is typically locked up for a decade.

**Back of the envelope power law math**

Some VCs take a [probability-driven approach](https://10xcapital.beehiiv.com/p/optimal-vc-portfolio-construction) to ensure their portfolio includes at least one breakout winner. The basic logic goes like this:

*   Assume a startup has a 5% chance of delivering a 20x+ return.
*   If you invest in just one company, there’s a 95% chance you miss a big winner.
*   If you invest in two, the chance of missing a winner drops to 90% (95% × 95%).
*   Keep investing, and the odds of missing a winner continue to shrink.

From here, one can set a threshold for failure—say, wanting a 20% or lower chance of having zero breakout winners—and backsolve to determine how many investments to make (32 in this case).

_Why it isn’t a perfect fit for VC_:

*   The failure threshold is arbitrary—too low, and you dilute your best bets; too high, and you risk missing a winner altogether.
*   It treats startup outcomes as binary (big winner or bust), ignoring the reality that many exits fall somewhere in between.
*   A more nuanced approach would factor in different return profiles and optimize accordingly.

**Monte Carlo simulations**

This method runs thousands—sometimes millions—of randomized scenarios based on assumed success rates and exits, testing different allocation strategies to identify the best.

_Why it isn’t a perfect fit for VC_:

*   Like all models, Monte Carlo is only as good as its inputs. Assumptions about success rates and exit values are just that—assumptions. Even using robust historical venture data doesn’t guarantee reliability.
*   For example, AngelList ran Monte Carlo simulations using data from 3,000+ past investments. One might expect a dataset of that size to produce generalizable conclusions. However, [adding just a few breakout investments drastically altered the projected returns](https://www.openvc.app/blog/vc-portfolio-construction):
    *   Adding Peter Thiel’s Facebook seed investment shifted the average return from 2.7x to 5.9x.
    *   Including Google’s and Uber’s seed rounds pushed it to 27.7x.
*   Monte Carlo is useful for modeling potential outcomes and assessing risk, but it can’t predict the future. Even running simulations on a perfectly curated dataset of every VC deal from the last decade wouldn’t ensure reliable forecasts—past performance isn’t indicative of future results.

### So… how should you construct your portfolio?

Each of these methods has flaws, but together, they offer a rough picture of effective venture portfolio construction.

They suggest that early-stage funds should aim for 25-40 investments per fund. This range balances the potential for capturing breakout winners while avoiding excessive dilution.

However, portfolio construction isn’t just math—it’s strategy. Models can give a broad range of appropriate portfolio concentrations, but they can’t tell you exactly how many bets to make or when to make a single more concentrated bet. Our decision to allocate $5M—20% of our fund—into a single company wasn’t model-driven. In fact, most models would have cautioned against it.

Below are some strategic reasons for varying degrees of portfolio concentration.

_Arguments for less concentration_

*   **Firm longevity**: A broader portfolio increases the odds of landing a power-law outcome. An overconcentrated fund that strikes out may compromise future fundraises. LPs won’t tolerate a decade of locked up capital for a <1x MOIC. Diversification may sacrifice upside in a single fund, but it can keep a firm in the game. If our $5M bet had missed and the rest of the portfolio underperformed, our concentration strategy would have been scrutinized, potentially leading to some tough conversations with LPs.
*   **Leading vs. following**: Larger checks often mean leading rounds, which comes with extra responsibilities—diligence, term negotiation, and board seats to name a few. Not all firms are structured and willing to lead.
*   **Poker analogy**: Fred Wilson compares [early-stage investing to poker](https://avc.com/2004/11/the_poker_analo/). Players put in a small ante to see their cards before deciding whether to bet a larger amount. Similarly, a small early check secures a seat at the table, giving investors time to assess execution from the inside. A diversified approach in early stages increases exposure to potentially strong performers, enabling investors to deploy follow-on capital with greater conviction in subsequent rounds.

_Arguments for more concentration_

*   **Conviction**: When a standout team, market tailwinds, and early traction align, a concentrated investment can be the right move. While conviction should underpin every investment (ideally), some opportunities inspire greater confidence than others. When that happens, check size should reflect it.
*   **Deeper involvement and better follow-on decisions**: A concentrated portfolio lets investors be more hands-on, building stronger relationships with founders and offering targeted support. With fewer companies to track, follow-on decisions are also more informed.
*   **Quality over quantity**: More deals can mean spreading capital too thin or investing in lower-quality startups just to fill a portfolio. If a fund can reliably identify its strongest investments _at the time of investment_, concentrating more on those maximizes returns.
*   **Top-tier funds tend to concentrate capital**: Data shows [higher-performing funds tend to be more concentrated](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/big-winners-bold-concentration-unveiling-secret-portfolio-shuman-mwmze/). Whether through larger initial checks or follow-on investment, they focus on companies with the highest potential for outsized returns.

### Conviction and check size dynamacy 

Our $5M bet wasn’t one of five evenly sized investments within our $25M fund—it was an outlier. The fund made 20 investments, keeping it relatively concentrated, but this check was unusually large. It was placed with conviction, and in hindsight, it paid off.

Had this bet failed, we would have reassessed our approach to concentration. Big swings carry big risks, and a miss would have been a tough reminder of the balance between focus and diversification.

While we haven’t committed 20% of a fund to one company since, this experience reinforced conviction’s role in our portfolio construction. Since then, we’ve leaned on it more heavily, ensuring we’re positioned to bet big when the right opportunity presents itself.

Venture capital is as much an art as a science. The real challenge isn’t just portfolio sizing—it’s knowing when to take a concentrated risk and having the discipline to live with the outcome, whether it’s a hard-earned lesson or a $100M success.
