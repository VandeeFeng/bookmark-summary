## Summary
**摘要**：
文章探讨了社会与个体之间的微妙关系，指出社会通过奖励机制鼓励个体行为，以促进自身的生存和发展。然而，这种机制在“赢者通吃”的法则下，使得大多数人难以获得成功，社会却通过制造“现实扭曲场”来激励人们竞争，从而受益。文章作者认为，这种竞争对社会有利，但对个体而言可能并非最佳选择。作者提倡一种不竞争的生活方式，即不盲目追求社会认可，而是专注于个人 fulfillment。通过享受他人竞争带来的成果，同时从事自己真正喜欢的事情，如园艺、制作咖啡或开发小游戏，在工作中忽略社会强加的“正确”观念，追求个人内在的满足感。如果每个人都这样做，社会的整体幸福感将会提升，人们会因为热爱而自发地创造价值，从而在生活中专注于“无限游戏”，而不是追求成为顶尖人物。

**要点总结**：
1.  社会通过奖励机制（如社会认可和赞扬）来鼓励个体行为，从而促进自身的生存和发展。这种机制鼓励人们为了社会利益而努力工作和创新，但同时也可能导致个体牺牲个人福祉去追求社会认可的成功。

2.  在“赢者通吃”的社会结构下，大多数人难以达到社会所定义的成功标准，但社会仍然通过各种方式（如媒体宣传）来营造一种努力就能成功的氛围，从而激励人们参与竞争。这种竞争对社会整体是有益的，因为它可以推动创新和发展，但对个体而言，可能会导致过度的压力和不幸福感。

3.  文章作者提倡一种“不竞争”的生活方式，即个体不应盲目追求社会认可的成功，而应专注于寻找和从事自己真正喜欢的事情。这意味着个体需要摆脱社会价值观的束缚，关注内在的兴趣和激情，从而实现个人价值和幸福感。

4.  通过不参与激烈的社会竞争，个体可以更好地享受他人竞争所带来的成果，例如阅读好书、观看有趣的电影、使用最新的科技产品等。同时，个体可以将更多的时间和精力投入到自己喜欢的事情上，例如园艺、制作咖啡、开发小游戏等，从而在工作中获得乐趣和满足感。

5.  如果每个人都选择从事自己真正喜欢的事情，而不是盲目追求社会认可的成功，社会的整体幸福感将会提升。在这种情况下，人们会因为热爱而自发地创造价值，而不是为了竞争而工作。这将促使人们专注于“无限游戏”，即追求持续的个人成长和发展，而不是追求成为顶尖人物。

The Internet is full of people winning all the time. Someone is traveling to exotic locations, someone else is raising funds, and another person is winning awards. Essentially, everyone around you is succeeding while you do spend your days as the nature intended – sleeping, eating, smiling, chatting with friends, and spending time with your cat.

But, who here is _really_ winning?

Imagine our society as a living and breathing organism with its own agenda. What would be on its agenda? First of all, like you, society would want to not die. Second, like you, it would want to thrive.

Ask yourself – how can the society achieve these things?

**The only agency our society has is via its constituents, i.e. _you_ and me**. The society acts by having its members act. (It’s pretty much the same for you – your agency is realized by your body cells).

So, for a society to survive and thrive, it needs to reward its agents when they do things that help in its preservation and growth. This reward comes in the form of social approval. **You invent something new, the society benefits and in returns showers you** with the [dopamine hit](https://invertedpassion.com/a-primer-on-dopamine/) of public applause.

So far, so good. Nothing wrong with a mutually beneficial exchange. You do something good for the society and the society gives something back to you which feels great.

EXCEPT THIS BASICALLY NEVER HAPPENS
-----------------------------------

Out of the 8 billion people on Earth, how many can actually get to a unicorn status, win Nobel prize, write best seller books, travel around the world or get to a million subscribers?

Because our world is dominated by winner-take-all [power laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_law), **the odds are practically zero for most people to get to an outcome they see daily in their feeds or news articles.**

And yet it’s beneficial for the society to create a reality distortion field so people start believing that all this is not just possible, but is actually achievable only we work a little bit harder. Only if we hustle more. Only if we work 80 hours a week.

You see, **ultimately the society stands to benefit from this competition between people**. Highlight and celebrate the lottery winner to fool enough people into competing with each other to make everyone life better.

Ask yourself – who really benefits when you sacrifice your health to take one more meeting?

It’s not you obviously. Rather, it’s the society because only when millions of people take one more meeting, someone somewhere will stumble upon something which is hugely valuable to everyone.

How else will humanity stumble upon the next transistor if everyone is sleeping an extra hour instead of using that time to search for the next big thing?

Yeah – it’s a crazy _asymmetric_ dynamic!

If you think about it, our society is structured a lot like the actual lottery. Pubilcize a multi-million dollar jackpot winner and have hundreds of thousands of people shell out their hard earned money. Tax the jackpot and build roads with it.

WHAT’S GOOD FOR SOCIETY MAY NOT BE GOOD FOR YOU
-----------------------------------------------

In most modern cultures, direct coercion doesn’t exist. Nobody can make you work harder than you want to. **However, with our infinite algorithmic timelines, we’re immersed with indirect coercion.**

But, you do not have to participate in the lottery. You can choose to quit. You can decide to not compete. You can choose to not participate in the lottery, where you’d almost likely lose more than you receive in return.

To be clear, this doesn’t mean inactivity. ([Life is a game](https://invertedpassion.com/review-of-life/), where inactivity means death.)

Rather, what this implies is something very simple – **don’t confuse what gets social approval with what’s right for you**. Social approval exists to attract participants in a game that ultimately benefits the collective at the expense of an individual.

You can be smarter. You can turn the game around.

ENJOY THE RICHES WHILE PLAYING YOUR OWN GAME
--------------------------------------------

Once you overcome your desire to compete with others, you can actually just sit back and enjoy the outcomes that others compete to produce for you.

Read great books, watch interesting movies, dance to the music, use latest gadgets, and eat good food.

**Let others compete hard to let you enjoy these things, while you do what you find most fun**. It could be tending to your garden, working at a sensible pace, making coffee, building tiny weird games, or whatever else makes you come alive.

I hear you ask: won’t society collapse if everyone did this? I’d argue the opposite. **If everyone did what they find most fulfilling, our net happiness will rise**. Artifacts useful to the society will still be produced, except with less anxiety and burnout. People will still write books, but without an intent of it trying to be a bestseller but with an intent of honing and enjoying their craft.

In this world, [greatness will still occur without being aimed for](https://invertedpassion.com/getting-things-done-by-not-trying/). Everyone will chase butterflies of their curiosity and do things for their own sake instead of hustling to be on the top.

People will stop playing finite games, but **focus entirely on creating infinite games with their lives.**

The point is not to avoid working hard, but it is to work on things you find fulfilling while completely ignoring what you think is the _objectively_ right thing to do (which is often an idea implanted into your head by the society).

Remember: there are no rules!

(Except physics, of course!)
