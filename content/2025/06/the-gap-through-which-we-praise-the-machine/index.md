## Summary
**摘要**：文章探讨了AI编程助手（如LLMs）在软件开发中的实际应用与预期之间的差距。作者指出，虽然投资者和高管普遍认为AI工具能提高效率并强制推行使用，但实际效果取决于开发者如何适应和引导这些工具。成功的用户往往需要大量调整和设置（如优化提示、配置规则文件和监控成本）来弥补AI的不足，而这些工作常被忽视。作者批评当前AI工具的设计过于拟人化，导致用户须承担更多调整和纠正的责任，而非真正提升效率。最终，作者呼吁重新设计AI工具，使其更符合实际工作流程，减少用户的学习和适应负担。  

**要点总结**：  
1. **AI工具的预期与现实的差距**：高管和投资者普遍认为AI工具能大幅提升开发效率，但实际效果依赖于开发者对工具的调整和引导。这种预期与现实的差距导致用户需执行大量额外工作（如优化提示、管理配置）才能使AI工具真正可用。  
2. **成功用户的关键技能**：开发者需通过复杂的脚手架（如规则文件、提示优化）和持续的纠正行为来弥补AI工具的不足。这些技能常被内化为隐性经验，使得AI看起来更有效，但实际上用户承担了更多工作。  
3. **设计师对工具的责任**：作者批评当前AI工具的设计过于拟人化，导致用户难以预测和控制其行为。更好的设计应减少用户的学习负担，使其更专注于工具的核心功能，而非适应工具的行为模式。  
4. **社会和组织因素**：团队文化、个人对AI的信任度以及对工具的评判标准（如基准测试）会影响用户对AI的接受度。竞争性文化可能加剧对AI的抵触，而学习型文化则更易接受AI的协作。

In this post I’ll expose my current theory of agentic programming: people are amazing at adapting the tools they’re given and totally underestimate the extent to which they do it, and the amount of skill we build doing that is an incidental consequence of how badly the tools are designed.

I’ll first cover some of the drive behind AI assistant adoption in software, the stochastic-looking divide in expectations and satisfactions with these tools, and the desire to figure out an explanation for that phenomenon.

I’ll then look at what successful users seem to do, explore the type of scaffolding and skills they need to grow to do well with LLMs when coding or implementing features. By borrowing analytical ideas from French Ergonomists, I’ll then explain how this extensive adaptive work highlights a gap in interaction design from AI tool builders, which is what results in tricky skill acquisition.

Basically, things could be much better if we spent less time congratulating machines for the work people do and we instead supported people more directly.

### Money Claps for Tinkerbell, and so Must You

A few months ago, Charity Majors and I gave the [closing plenary talk at SRECon Americas 2025](https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon25americas/presentation/majors). While we were writing the talk, trying to thread a needle between skepticism and optimism, Charity mentioned one thing I hadn’t yet understood by then but was enlightening: investors in the industry already have divided up companies in two categories, pre-AI and post-AI, and they are asking “what are you going to do to not be beaten by the post-AI companies?”

The usefulness and success of using LLMs are axiomatically taken for granted and the mandate for their adoption can often come from above your CEO. Your execs can be as baffled as anyone else having to figure out where to jam AI into their product. Adoption may be forced to keep board members, investors, and analysts happy, regardless of what customers may be needing.

It does not matter whether LLMs can or cannot deliver on what they promise: people calling the shots assume they can, so it’s gonna happen no matter what. _I’m therefore going to bypass any discussion of the desirability, sustainability, and ethics of AI_ here, and jump directly to “well you gotta build with it anyway or find a new job” as a premise. My main focus will consequently be on people who engage with the tech based on these promises, and how they do it. There’s a wide spectrum where at one end you have “true believers,” and at the other you have people convinced of the opposite—that this is all fraudulent shit that can’t work.

In practice, what I’m seeing is a bunch of devs who derive real value from it at certain types of tasks and workflows ranging from copilot-as-autocomplete to full agentic coding, and some who don’t and keep struggling to find ways to add LLMs to their workflows (either because they must due to some top-down mandate, or because they fear they’ll be left behind if they don’t[1](https://ferd.ca/the-gap-through-which-we-praise-the-machine.html#footnote-1)). I can also find no obvious correlation between where someone lands on that spectrum and things like experience levels; people fall here and there regardless of where they work, how much trust I have in their ability, how good they are at communicating, how much of a hard worker they are, or how willing to learn they might be.

### A Theory of Division

So where does that difference come from? It could be easy to assign dissatisfaction to “you just gotta try harder”, or “some people work differently”, or “you go fast now but you are just creating more problems for later.” These all may be true to some degree, and the reality is surely a rich multifactorial mess. We also can’t ignore broader social and non-individual elements like the type of organizational culture people evolve in,[2](https://ferd.ca/the-gap-through-which-we-praise-the-machine.html#footnote-2) on top of variations that can be seen within single teams.

My gut feeling is that, on top of all the potential factors already identified, people underestimate their own situatedness (how much they know and interpret and adjust from “thing I am told to build” and tie that to a richer contextualized “thing that makes sense to build” by being connected participants in the real world and the problem space) and how much active interpretation and steering work they do when using and evaluating coding assistants.[3](https://ferd.ca/the-gap-through-which-we-praise-the-machine.html#footnote-3) Those who feel the steering process as taxing end up having a worse time and blame the machine for negative outcomes; those for whom it feels easy in turn praise the machine for the positive results.

This tolerance for steering is likely moderated or amplified by elements such as how much people trust themselves and how much they trust the AI, how threatened they might feel by it, their existing workflows, the support they might get, and the type of “benchmarks” they choose (also influenced by the preceding factors).[4](https://ferd.ca/the-gap-through-which-we-praise-the-machine.html#footnote-4)

I’m advancing this theory because the people I’ve seen most excited and effective about agentic work were deeply involved in constantly correcting and recognizing bugs or loops or dead ends the agent was getting into, steering them away from it, while also adding a bunch of technical safeguards and markers to projects to try and make the agents more effective. When willingly withholding these efforts, their agents’ token costs would double as they kept growing their context windows through repeating the same dead-end patterns; oddities and references to non-existing code would accumulate, and the agents would increasingly do unhinged stuff like removing tests they wrote but could no longer pass.

I’ve seen people take the blame for that erratic behavior on themselves (“oh I should have prompted in _that_ way instead, my bad”), while others would just call out the agent for being stupid or useless.

The early frustration I have seen (and felt) seems to be due to hitting these road blocks and sort of going “wow, this sucks and isn’t what was advertised.” If you got more adept users around you, they’ll tell you to try different models, tweak bits of what you do, suggest better prompts, and offer jargon-laden workarounds.

![Image 1: remake of the old comic strip telling the user to 'write a map-reduce in Erlang' to query the DB and resulting in 'Did you just tell me to go fuck myself?' and 'I believe I did, Bob.' This version has the first character ask 'How do I make the AI learn things?', with the response 'It doesn't it grows stateless context'. The next panel has the character clarifying 'ok, it doesn't. How do I make it remember?' to which the other responds 'You have to use the LLM as its own MCP server!', which leads to an unchanged original panel ('... I believe I did, Bob')](https://ferd.ca/static/img/llm-as-its-own-mcp-server.jpg)

That gap between “what we are told the AI can do” and “what it actually does out of the box” is significant. To bridge that gap, engineers need to do a lot of work.

### The Load-bearing Scaffolding of Effective Users

There are tons of different artifacts, mechanisms, and tips and tricks required to make AI code agents work. To name a few, as suggested by vendors and multiple blog posts, you may want to do things such as:

*   Play and experiment with multiple models, figure out which to use and when, and from which interfaces, which all can significantly change your experience.
*   Agent-specific configuration files (such as [CLAUDE.md](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-code-best-practices), [AGENTS.md](https://agentsmd.net/), or other [rule files](https://windsurf.com/editor/directory)) that specify project structure, commands, style guidelines, testing strategies, conventions, potential pitfalls, and other information. There can be one or more of them, in multiple locations, and adjusted to specific users.
*   Optimize your prompts by adding personality or character traits and special role-play instructions, possibly relying on [prompt improvers](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/prompt-improver).
*   Install or create [MCP servers](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) to extend the abilities of your agents. Some examples can include file management or source control, but can also do stuff like giving access to production telemetry data or issue trackers.
*   Use files as memory storage for past efforts made by the agent.
*   Specify [checkpoints](https://docs.devin.ai/essential-guidelines/instructing-devin-effectively#set-checkpoints) and [manage permissions](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/security) to influence when user input may be required.
*   Monitor your [usage and cost](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/monitoring-usage).

There are more options there, and each can branch out into lots of subtle qualitative details: workarounds for code bases too large for the model’s context, defining broader evaluation strategies, working around cut-off dates, ingesting docs, or all preferences around specific coding, testing, and interaction methods. Having these artifacts in place can significantly alter someone’s experience. Needing to come up with and maintain these could be framed as increasing the effort required for successful adoption.

I’ve seen people experimenting, even with these elements in place, failing to get good results, and then being met with “yeah, of course, that’s a terrible prompt” followed with suggestions of what to improve (things like “if the current solution works, say it works so the agent does not try to change it”, asking for real examples to try and prevent fake ones, or being [more or less polite](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5165270)).

For example, a coworker used a prompt that, among many other instructions, had one line stating “use the newest version of `<component>` so we can use `<feature>`”. The agent ignored that instruction and used an older version of the component. My coworker reacted by saying “I set myself up for refactoring by not specifying the exact version.”

From an objective point of view, asking for the newest version of the component is a very specific instruction: only one version is the newest, and the feature that was specified only existed in that version. There is no ambiguity. Saying “version `$X.0`” is semantically the same. But my coworker knew, from experience, that a version number would yield better results, and took it on themselves to do better next time.

These interactions show that engineers have internalized a complex set of heuristics to guide and navigate the LLM’s idiosyncrasies. That is, they’ve built a mental model of complex and hardly predictable agentic behavior (and of how it all interacts with the set of rules and artifacts and bits of scaffolding they’ve added to their repos and sessions) to best predict what will or won’t yield good results, and then do extra corrective work ahead of time through prompting variations. This is a skill that makes a difference.

That you need to do these things might in fact point at how agentic AI does not behave with cognitive fluency,[5](https://ferd.ca/the-gap-through-which-we-praise-the-machine.html#footnote-5) and instead, the user subtly does it on its behalf in order to be productive.

Whether you will be willing to provide that skill for the machine may require a mindset or position that I’ll caricature as “I just need to get better”, as opposed to taking a stance of “the LLM needs to get better”. I suspect this stance, whether it is chosen deliberately or not, will influence how much interaction (and course-correcting) one expects to handle while still finding an agent useful or helpful.

I don’t know that engineers even realize they’re doing that type of work, that they’re essential to LLMs working for code, that the tech is fascinating but maybe not that useful without the scaffolding and constant guidance they provide. At least, people who speak of AI replacing engineers probably aren’t fully aware that while engineers could maybe be doing more work through assisting an agent than they would do alone, agents would still not do good work without the engineer. AI is [normal technology](https://knightcolumbia.org/content/ai-as-normal-technology), in that its adoption, propagation, and the efforts to make it work all follow predictable patterns. LLMs, as a piece of tech, mainly offer some unrealized potential.

It may sound demeaning, like I’m implying people lack awareness of their own processes, but it absolutely isn’t. The process of adaptation is often not obvious, even to the people doing it. There are lots of strategies and patterns and behaviors people pick up or develop tacitly as a part of trying to meet goals. Cognitive work that gets deeply ingrained sometimes just feels effortless, natural, and obvious. Unless you’re constantly interacting with newcomers, you forget what you take for granted—you just know what you know and get results.

By extension, my supposition is that those who won’t internalize the idiosyncrasies and the motions of doing the scaffolding work are disappointed far more quickly: they may provide more assistance to the agent than the agent provides to them, and this is seen as the AI failing to improve their usual workflow and to deliver on the wonders advertised by its makers.

### The Gap Highlighted Through Adaptive Work

What AI sells is vastly different from what it delivers, particularly what it delivers out of the box. In their study of the difference between [work-as-imagined (WAI) and work-as-done (WAD)](https://humanisticsystems.com/2016/12/05/the-varieties-of-human-work/), ergonomists and resilience engineers have developed a useful framing device to understand what’s going on.

Work-as-imagined describes the work as it is anticipated or expected to happen, how it can be specified and described. The work-as-done comprises the work as it is carried out, along with the supporting tasks, deviations, meanings, and their relationships to the prescribed tasks.

By looking at how people turn artifacts they’re given into useful tools, we can make sense of that gap.[6](https://ferd.ca/the-gap-through-which-we-praise-the-machine.html#footnote-6) This adjustment ends up transforming both the artifacts (by modifying and configuring them) and the people using them (through learning and by changing their behavior). The difference between the original artifact developed by the people planning the work and the forms that end up effectively used in the field offer a clue of the mismatch between WAI and WAD.

Tying this back to our LLM systems, what is imagined is powerful agents who replace engineers (at least junior ones), make everyone more productive, and that will be a total game changer. LLMs are artifacts. The scaffolding we put in place to control them are how we try to transform the artifacts into tools; the learning we do to get better at prompting and interacting with the LLMs is part of how they transform us. If what we have to do to be productive with LLMs is to add a lot of scaffolding and invest effort to gain important but poorly defined skills, we should be able to assume that what we’re sold and what we get are rather different things.

That gap implies that better designed artifacts could have better affordances, and be more appropriate to the task at hand. They would be easier to turn into productive tools. A narrow gap means fewer adaptations are required, and a wider gap implies more of them are needed.

Flipping it around, we have to ask whether the amount of scaffolding and skill required by coding agents is acceptable. If we think it is, then our agent workflows are on the right track. If we’re a bit baffled by all that’s needed to make it work well, we may rightfully suspect that we’re not being sold the right stuff, or at least stuff with the right design.

### Bad Interaction Design Demands Greater Coping Skills

I fall in the baffled camp that thinks better designs are possible. In a fundamental sense, LLMs can be assumed to be there to impress you. Their general focus on anthropomorphic interfaces—just have a chat!—makes them charming, misguides us into attributing more agency and intelligence than they have, which makes it even more challenging for people to control or use them predictably. [Sycophancy](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.15287v1) is one of the many challenges here, for example.

Coding assistants, particularly agents, are narrower in their interface, but they build on a similar interaction model. They aim to look like developers, independent entities that can do the actual work. The same anthropomorphic interface is in place, and we similarly must work even harder to peel the veneer of agency they have to properly predict them and apply them in controlled manners.

You can see the outline of this when a coding agent reaches limits it has no awareness of, like when it switches from boilerplate generation (where we’re often fine letting it do its thing) to core algorithms (where we want involvement to avoid major refactors) without proper hand-offs or pauses. Either precise prompting must be done to preempt and handle the mode switch, or we find the agent went too far and we must fix (or rewrite) buggy code rather than being involved at the right time.

And maybe the issue is prompting, maybe it’s the boilerplatey nature of things, maybe it’s because there was not enough training material for your language or framework. Maybe your config files aren’t asking for the right persona, or another model could do better. Maybe it’s that we don’t even know what exactly is the boundary where our involvement is more critical. Figuring that out requires skill, but also it’s kind of painful to investigate as a self-improvement workflow.

Coding agents require the scaffolding, learning, and often demand more attention than tools, but are built to look like teammates. This makes them both unwieldy tools and lousy teammates. We should either have agents designed to look like a teammate properly act like a teammate, and barring that, have a tool that behaves like a tool. This is the point I make in [AI: Where in the Loop Should Humans Go?](https://ferd.ca/ai-where-in-the-loop-should-humans-go.html), where a dozen questions are offered to evaluate how well this is done.

Key problems that arise when we’re in the current LLM landscape include:

*   AI that aims to improve us can ironically end up deskilling us;
*   Not knowing whether we are improving the computers or augmenting people can lead to unsustainable workflows and demands;
*   We risk putting people in passive supervision and monitoring roles, which is known not to work well;
*   We may artificially constrain and pigeonhole how people approach problems, and reduce the scope of what they can do;
*   We can adopt known anti-patterns in team dynamics that reduce overall system efficiency;
*   We can create structural patterns where people are forced to become accountability scapegoats.

Hazel Weakly comes up with related complaints in [Stop Building AI Tools Backwards](https://hazelweakly.me/blog/stop-building-ai-tools-backwards/), where she argues for design centered on collaborative learning patterns (Explain, Demonstrate, Guide, Enhance) to play to the strengths that make people and teams effective, rather than one that reinforces people into being ineffective.

Some people may hope that better models will eventually meet expectations and narrow the gap on their own. My stance is that rather than anchoring coding agent design into ideals of science fiction (magical, perfect workers granting your wishes), they should be grounded in actual science. The gap would be narrowed much more effectively then. AI tool designers should study how to integrate solutions to existing dynamics, and plan to align with known strength and limitations of automation.

### We Oversell Machines by Erasing Ourselves

Being able to effectively use LLMs for programming demands a lot of scaffolding and skills. The skills needed are, however, poorly defined and highly context dependent, such that we currently don’t have great ways of improving them other than long periods of trial and error.[7](https://ferd.ca/the-gap-through-which-we-praise-the-machine.html#footnote-7)

The problem is that while the skills are real and important, I would argue that the level of sophistication they demand is an accidental outcome of poor interaction design. Better design, aimed more closely to how real work is done, could drastically reduce the amount of scaffolding and learning required (and the ease with which learning takes place).

I don’t expect my calls to be heard. Selling sci-fi is way too effective. And as long as the AI is perceived as the engine of a new industrial revolution, decision-makers will imagine it can do so, and task people to make it so.

Things won’t change, because people are adaptable and want the system to succeed. We consequently take on the responsibility for making things work, through ongoing effort and by transforming ourselves in the process. Through that work, we make the technology appear closer to what it promises than what it actually delivers, which in turn reinforces the pressure to adopt it.

As we take charge of bridging the gap, the machine claims the praise.

[1](https://ferd.ca/the-gap-through-which-we-praise-the-machine.html#footref-1): Dr. Cat Hicks has shared some [great research on factors related to this](https://www.drcathicks.com/post/new-research-from-me-ai-skill-threat-contest-cultures-on-software-teams), stating that competitive cultures that assume brilliance is innate and internal tend to lead to a much larger perceived threat from AI regarding people’s skills, whereas learning cultures with a sense of belonging lowered that threat. Upskilling can be impacted by such threats, along with other factors described in the summaries and [the preprint](https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/2gej5_v2).

[2](https://ferd.ca/the-gap-through-which-we-praise-the-machine.html#footref-2): Related to the previous footnote, Dr. Cat Hicks here once again shares research on [cumulative culture](https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/tfjyw_v1), a framing that shows how collaborative innovation and learning can be, and offers an alternative construct to individualistic explanations for software developers’ problem solving.

[3](https://ferd.ca/the-gap-through-which-we-praise-the-machine.html#footref-3): A related concept might be [Moravec’s Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moravec%27s_paradox). Roughly, this classic AI argument states that we tend to believe higher order reasoning like maths and logic is very difficult because it _feels_ difficult to us, but the actually harder stuff (perception and whatnot) is very easy to us because we’re so optimized for it.

[4](https://ferd.ca/the-gap-through-which-we-praise-the-machine.html#footref-4): The concept of self-trust and AI trust is explored in [The Impact of Generative AI on Critical Thinking](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/lee_2025_ai_critical_thinking_survey.pdf) by HPH Lee and Microsoft Research. The impact of AI skill threat is better defined in [the research in footnote 1](https://ferd.ca/the-gap-through-which-we-praise-the-machine.html#footnote-1). The rest is guesswork.

The guess about “benchmarks” is based on observations that people may use heuristics like checking how it does at things you’re good at to estimate how you can trust it at things you’ve got less expertise on. This can be a useful strategy but can also raise criteria for elements where expertise may not be needed (say, boilerplate), and high expectations can lay the groundwork for easier disappointment.

[5](https://ferd.ca/the-gap-through-which-we-praise-the-machine.html#footref-5): The [Law of Fluency](https://github.com/lorin/resilience-engineering/blob/master/laws.md#law-of-fluency) states that _Well-adapted cognitive work occurs with a facility that belies the difficulty of resolving demands and balancing dilemmas_, basically stating that if you’ve gotten good at stuff, you make it look a lot easier than it actually is to do things.

[6](https://ferd.ca/the-gap-through-which-we-praise-the-machine.html#footref-6): This idea comes from [a recent French ergonomics paper](https://ferd.ca/notes/paper-when-resilience-engineering-questions-ergonomics.html). It states that “Artifacts represent for the worker a part of the elements of WAI. These artifacts can become tools only once the workers become users, when they appropriate them. [Tools] are an aggregation of artifacts (WAI) and of usage schemas by those who use them in the field (WAD).”

[7](https://ferd.ca/the-gap-through-which-we-praise-the-machine.html#footref-7): One interesting anecdote here is hearing people say they found it challenging to switch from their personal to corporate accounts for some providers, because something in their personal sessions had made the LLMs work better with their style of prompting and this got lost when switching.

Other factors here include elements such as how [updating models can significantly impact user experience](https://openai.com/index/expanding-on-sycophancy/), which may point to a lack of stable feedback that can also make skill acquisition more difficult.
