## Summary
**摘要**：
文章探讨了在与大型语言模型（LLM）如Cline交互时，如何更有效地引导对话以达成预期目标。作者指出，当对话偏离预期时，常见的纠正方式往往效果不佳，因为LLM在多轮对话中性能会下降39%。研究显示，LLM在“快乐路径”（一次性接收完整上下文信息）下表现最佳，而在多轮对话中由于“上下文污染”而难以纠正偏差。为此，Cline引入了“消息检查点”功能，允许用户回溯到对话偏离前的状态，重新编辑并发送更清晰的提示，从而避免陷入不断纠正的恶性循环。这种方法充分利用了LLM在完整上下文下表现最佳的特性，显著提升了工作效率。

**要点总结**：
1. **LLM在多轮对话中性能下降**：研究表明，当指令分散在多个对话回合中时，LLM的性能平均下降39%，这与一次性提供完整上下文相比效果显著较差。
2. **“快乐路径”优化**：LLM在一次性接收完整且清晰的输入时表现最佳，这种路径称为“快乐路径”，而试图在多轮对话中纠正偏差往往适得其反。
3. **上下文污染的负面影响**：在多轮对话中，LLM的上下文会被其生成的假设、用户的纠正以及未纠正部分的隐含验证所污染，导致后续对话难以回到正轨。
4. **消息检查点的解决方案**：Cline的“消息检查点”功能允许用户回溯到对话偏离前的状态，重新编辑提示并重置上下文，从而避免上下文污染并利用LLM的“快乐路径”特性。
5. **计划模式与执行模式的适用性**：无论是计划模式还是执行模式，消息检查点都能有效帮助用户修正偏离的对话或任务，重新提供清晰的指令以达成目标。

You're ten messages deep with Cline. What started as a simple task – "add authentication to this Express app" – has somehow morphed into a sprawling mess where the model is suggesting OAuth implementations when you just needed basic JWT, restructuring your entire database schema, and confidently explaining why you should migrate to microservices. You know exactly what went wrong: somewhere around message three, when you said "make it secure," the model veered off into enterprise-grade architecture territory.

Your instinct is to course-correct. _"No, let's keep it simple. Just JWT. Remember the original requirements."_ But each correction seems to dig you deeper. The model acknowledges your feedback, considers some of it, building on its own previous suggestions rather than truly reconsidering. You're not collaborating anymore; you're wrestling.

But what if you could go back in time to the exact moment the conversation went wrong, rewrite your prompt, and try again? Here's what's actually happening, and why this "conversational time travel" is the right approach.

LLMs like happy paths
---------------------

Recent research from[Laban et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06120?ref=cline.ghost.io)reveals something fundamental about how LLMs process information: they experience a 39% average performance drop when instructions are delivered across multiple conversation turns compared to receiving complete context upfront. And while the paper's simulation uses a simplified version of a real-world dialogue, its findings are profound: if models struggle with clean, sequential information, they will struggle even more with the messy, back-and-forth nature of a true creative or debugging session.

Performance drops 39% when messages are sharded over multiple conversation turns (as seen on the right)

LLMs are optimized for what we can call the "happy path" – a clear trajectory from comprehensive input to desired output. This is why course-correction feels like fighting the current. You're not just providing new information; you're asking the model to unlearn its previous assumptions while simultaneously building on them. The research shows this simply doesn't work well. When the same fragmented instructions were consolidated into a single prompt, performance jumped back to 95% of optimal.

This isn't just an academic finding; it's a reality recognized by other expert AI teams. Engineers at Anthropic, for instance, advise treating Claude Code like a "slot machine": save your state, let it run, and if the result isn't a jackpot, you start fresh rather than trying to wrestle with corrections. This practical advice perfectly mirrors the research: starting over has a higher success rate than trying to fix a model's mistakes mid-conversation.

The Anthropic team advises starting from scratch instead of trying to wrangle imperfect code

Course-correcting is an uphill battle
-------------------------------------

The key insight isn't that LLMs inevitably deteriorate. The issue is that once you've left the happy path, getting back on it through conversation is like trying to merge back onto a highway from a field. The model's context is now polluted with:

*   Its own generated assumptions and explanations
*   Your corrections and clarifications
*   The implicit validation of parts you didn't correct
*   Increasingly verbose attempts to reconcile conflicting information

Each message adds more context pollution. You're not debugging code; you're trying to debug a conversation, and conversations don't have clean stack traces.

Hacking the happy path with checkpoints
---------------------------------------

A workflow built around Cline's**message checkpoint**system solves this. It’s not just about undoing file changes; it’s about rewinding the conversation itself. When you edit a previous message in Cline, you're given the option to restore the task's state to the moment right before that message was sent. This is how you engineer your own happy path.

Here's how it works in practice:

1.   **You recognize the off-ramp.**The moment you think "oh, this is not what I wanted" -- that's your signal. Not to correct, but to find the message that sent things sideways.
2.   **You learn from the deviation.**The model's misunderstanding is valuable data. It shows you what context was missing from your original prompt.
3.   **You rewrite the divergent prompt.**Instead of trying to steer back, you find the exact message in the chat where the conversation went off track. You**edit that prompt**to include the missing context or clearer instructions.
4.   **You restore the context.**After editing the message, Cline presents you with the option to restore the state. You choose to **"Restore All"**, which resets the model's context to that point, erasing the subsequent "polluted" conversation. It also restores any new or edited files. Now, when you re-send the improved prompt, you're starting from a clean slate.
5.   **You ride the happy path.**With _better_ context, the model delivers exactly what you want, often better than what you would have gotten through multiple rounds of correction.

> **A Note on Plan vs. Act Mode:**This workflow is powerful in both of Cline's modes. In**Plan Mode**, you can use it to refine a plan that's getting off track. In**Act Mode**, it's essential for correcting an execution that has started to diverge from your intended plan. The principle is the same: reset the context and provide a better instruction.

Why this works
--------------

The research is clear: LLMs perform best with complete context delivered upfront. This reframes the problem: you're not debugging the model's code, you're debugging your prompt. The best way to fix a bad prompt isn't to patch it through a polluted conversation; it's to rewrite it with the benefit of hindsight.

Message checkpoints make this workflow seamless. They remove the friction of starting over, allowing you to work _with_ the grain of the model instead of fighting against it. By embracing the checkpoint-and-restart workflow, you're hacking the happy path, using the model's strengths, and creating the conditions to reclaim that 39% performance gap.
