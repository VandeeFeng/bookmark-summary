## Summary
**摘要**：
文章探讨了人工智能（AI）可能对人类社会和个人意义带来的深远影响。作者首先引用了日本“Ikigai”的概念，强调了人生目标和意义的重要性。随着AI技术的发展，许多工作岗位可能会被取代，人类的独特性——智慧，也将受到挑战。作者借用马的命运作为类比，指出如果人类不再是最聪明的物种，可能会面临经济地位下降甚至更糟的境地。文章进一步设想，即使AI创造了一个物质极大丰富的世界，人类也可能因为缺乏目标而感到空虚。作者提出了两种可能的解决方案：一是通过改变意识，超越对职业和社会角色的依赖；二是通过构建社会性的“幻觉”，例如对爱好赋予过度的重要性，从而人为地满足“Ikigai”的需求。文章以足球和虚构的树木雕刻“产业”为例，说明了这种“幻觉”构建的可能性。作者总结说，这种转变能否成功，取决于我们能否实现一个真正的后稀缺社会，解决AI对齐问题，并公平分配AI带来的利益。即使这些目标都实现了，社会也可能面临新的挑战，例如过度依赖社交媒体算法导致的被动和无助。

**要点总结**：
1.  **Ikigai 的重要性**：
    - "Ikigai"是日语中指代人生目标和意义的概念，是连接“所爱、所长、世界所需、可获得报酬”四个方面的交集。
    - 日本冲绳岛的长寿村落，其居民的共同特点是每个人都有明确的任务和目标，这为他们带来了生存的意义感和幸福感。
2.  **AI 对人类的潜在威胁**：
    - 随着人工智能的发展，人类可能不再是“最智慧”的物种，从而在经济和社会地位上被取代，就像汽车取代马车后马的命运一样。
    - AI 不仅会取代现有工作，还可能胜任新的工作类型，使得人类在经济上的重要性降低。
3.  **后稀缺社会中的挑战**：
    - 即使 AI 创造了一个物质极大丰富的世界，满足了人们的基本需求，人类仍然可能因为缺乏目标而感到空虚和迷茫，从而引发精神危机。
    - 在后稀缺时代，传统的“Ikigai”的两个支柱——“世界需要什么”和“你能为此获得报酬”可能变得无法实现。
4.  **应对 AI 挑战的两种策略**：
    - 改变人类的意识，超越对职业和社会角色的依赖，从而在没有“Ikigai”的情况下也能获得幸福和满足感，类似于佛教的教义。
    - 通过构建社会性的“幻觉”，例如对爱好赋予过度的重要性，从而人为地满足“Ikigai”的需求，例如足球运动和虚构的树木雕刻"产业"。
5.  **实现后稀缺社会的条件与潜在风险**：
    - 实现真正的后稀缺社会需要解决 AI 对齐问题，确保 AI 的目标与人类的利益一致，并公平分配 AI 带来的利益。
    - 即使实现了后稀缺社会，也可能面临新的挑战，例如过度依赖社交媒体算法导致的被动和无助，以及社会地位竞争带来的精神压力。

### Ikigai

There is a village in Japan with an unusual density of 100 year olds. This caught the interest of a group of scientists. To their surprise, the people in the village didn’t live healthier lives; they didn’t exercise more, eat healthier food nor did they sleep more. The one outstanding characteristic was that each inhabitant was assigned a task to ensure that everyone in the village had a purpose.

This was at least how the man next to me on the plane described it. After a quick fact check \[1\], it seems like they actually did eat healthier, but they also did put great importance on making sure everyone has a purpose. “Ikigai” is a Japanese concept referring to something that gives a person a sense of purpose, a reason for living. Your ikigai is the intersection between what you love, what you are good at, what the world needs and what you can be paid for.

The man on the plane had worked his entire life as the CEO of his own company. He had just recently semi-retired, and I don’t think I have ever seen someone so proud of something. Such pride over one’s career is surely the best conditions for a sweet retirement. But retiring fully he would never do he said. The lesson from the Japanese village resonated with him. Most of his friends had recently retired, and the ones that didn’t find a new purpose “died quickly” he said.

### The end of this world

AI will soon be able to do almost all jobs we have in today’s economy. Some people don’t think this will be the end of the world. Previous technology shifts created more jobs than they replaced. “Look at the industrial revolution! Yes, machines replaced many jobs, but they created even more”. However, this is not just another technology shift. This time, we (humans) are replacing our defining characteristic, our intelligence. New types of work will certainly be needed, but AI will be able to do them too.

The same people also point to the fact that the introduction of cars didn’t put horse drivers out of a job. Instead, they became car drivers. But what happened to the horses? A horse defining characteristic was its strength, but they were no longer the strongest. Horses’ relevance to the economy is now almost insignificant. This will be our fate too once we are no longer the wisest.

For horses, the consequences were more devastating than mere economic insignificance, as shown in the graph \[2\] above. When the most intelligent species at the time no longer aligned with horses’ interests, their population rapidly declined. This is a disturbingly plausible scenario for humanity if AI researchers fail to align AI’s goals with the goals of humans. But consider the best-case scenario: AI handles all tasks, and the benefits are evenly shared, meeting everyone’s basic needs. Yet remember the lesson from the Japanese village on the critical importance of purpose. In such a world, two of Ikigai’s four pillars become unattainable—the world would no longer truly need anything from us, nor would it rationally pay for human effort when AI outperforms us in every way. No one would die from hunger or thirst, but would we instead meet the same fate as the man on the plane’s friends?

### The same heaven

This is a big deal. A huge change in humanity’s collective consciousness. How will we ever manage to get through cocktail parties without the icebreaker “so, what do you do for a living?”. Our identity is so tied to our occupation that we say “I am a teacher”, instead of “I work as a teacher”. It makes sense; our work is a cog in the machine that gave humanity amazing things like penicillin, the scientific method and space travel. That is something to be proud of. But what will be our Ikigai when the machine has no use for our cog?

I’m currently reading A New Earth by Eckhart Tolle. The book challenges the common belief that your identity is defined by your thoughts, emotions, or social roles. Instead, Tolle suggests that true freedom and happiness come when you break free from this illusion. The title refers to a biblical prophecy in which a “new heaven” symbolizes a shift in human consciousness, and a “new earth” represents how this shift manifests in the physical world. This is the long-term solution to our upcoming identity crisis. This way, happiness is attainable without the two missing pillars of Ikigai. However, Buddha taught essentially the same ideas 2,500 years ago, and humanity hasn’t made much noticeable progress. Changing the way we think, a new heaven, takes time. Time we don’t have, given how soon superintelligent AI might come.

### A new earth

So, how can our physical reality adapt? How can we find happiness in this new world without a change in mindset? A plausible solution is to just fool ourselves that what we do is more meaningful than it is. In this new world, I think most people’s main pursuits will be close to what we today call “hobbies”. But unlike most hobbies, we will build big systems around them to fool ourselves that they are something the world needs. This way we artificially make the lost pillars in Ikigai attainable.

We already have many things like this today. Take soccer for example. Some of my happiest moments in life have come from this seemingly pointless activity. I remember the rush of joy, packed tightly in that small sports bar with a hundred people, everyone jumping, shouting, hugging, beer splashing into my hair, my voice disappearing from screams of pure happiness as my favorite team scored. I could not tell you what the meaning of 22 adults chasing after a ball is, but because of the system we have built around it, stadiums, journalists, fan clubs and broadcasting networks, I have no problem fooling myself when I am not being asked. These systems are key to maintaining the illusion. You don’t question its importance when it gets that much attention. The new earth will have more things like this. For example, we might get a tree-carving “industry”. Millions of people spending their days carefully sculpting beautiful shapes into the bark of city trees. Around them, a vast ecosystem emerges: journalists dissecting each artist’s style, critics passionately debating the merits of different carving techniques, even whole media empires dedicated entirely to documenting the lives of prominent tree-carvers. This might seem absurd, but try to explain soccer to someone without making it sound absurd.

The people caught right in the middle of this shift will have it hardest—especially those whose jobs disappear first. Societal illusions only stick when they’re collectively endorsed. You can’t fool yourself alone; everyone else has to play along too. But once they do, life might not actually look that different. The tree-carving journalist will probably still work 9 to 5. Eventually, we might even have technology sophisticated enough to physically rewire our brains, literally forcing ourselves to believe these illusions. But by then we won’t need to. It’ll already feel normal—like money, a fiction everyone accepts without hesitation. Of course, just as some people today reject the very idea of money, there will always be a few who see through the charade. Some will find peace in deeper wisdom, embracing something like Buddha’s teachings. Others, unable or unwilling to adapt, will face the same sudden emptiness that befell the friends of the man on the plane—and “die quickly.”

### Epilogue

This isn’t really a prediction—it’s more of a plausible story. As I said earlier, none of this works unless we first achieve a genuine post-scarcity world. And to reach that point, two big hurdles remain: solving AI alignment, and figuring out how to fairly distribute the fruits of aligned AI. Neither is guaranteed. Even if we do, a post-scarcity society might bring its own troubles. Imagine social media algorithms engineered by superhuman intelligence—they might become so addictive we’d struggle to ever look away. Dystopian scenarios where humanity slides into passive helplessness, as vividly portrayed in the (world’s best) movie Wall-E. But we don’t even need fiction to see what might happen: some groups today already experience something similar to post-scarcity, and their stories aren’t always encouraging. One example is wealthy wives living on Manhattan’s Upper East Side, as studied by anthropologist Wednesday Martin. They ended up trapped in elaborate status competitions that weren’t exactly great for their mental health \[3\]. The difference, of course, is that those wealthy wives are just a subgroup, with little influence over society at large. When everyone finds themselves in a post-scarcity world at the same time, fooling ourselves for the benefit of our well-being will be much easier.
