## Summary
**摘要**：
本文作者通过十个小故事，揭示了人们在面对变化、风险、激励、成功和认知等方面的常见心理误区。第一个故事讲述了安全带的普及缓慢，说明社会规范会阻碍进步，即使改进显而易见。第二个故事用敦刻尔克撤退的例子说明，竞争对手也能快速模仿你的成功。第三个故事通过说唱歌手的例子，强调了激励机制对行为的巨大影响。第四个故事讲述了投资者在经济危机中失败的案例，表明非理性趋势可能持续超出预期。第五个故事描述了苏格兰在黑死病期间的错误决策，说明人们倾向于认为风险只与他人有关。第六个故事讲述了一个复明妇女的故事，揭示了每个目标都有容易被忽视的负面影响。第七个故事则提醒人们反思当今社会可能存在的、未来会受到批判的不公正现象。第八个故事讲述了宇航员登月后的平淡反应，说明实际体验可能不如预期。最后一个故事通过数学家的疯狂想法，说明独特的人才往往伴随着独特的思维方式。

**要点总结**：

1.  **社会规范会阻碍进步，即使改进显而易见**：即使像安全带这样能显著降低死亡率的简单装置，其普及也经历了漫长的过程，这说明人们常常因为习惯或其他社会因素而抵制改变，即使这种改变明显有益。正如作者所说，人们不愿意承认自己过去的做法是错误的，这种心理阻碍了社会进步的速度。
2.  **竞争对手可以快速模仿你的成功**：敦刻尔克大撤退的例子表明，即使是你引以为傲的创新或成就，竞争对手也能迅速学习和复制。因此，在取得成功时，要保持谦逊和警惕，认识到其他人也在努力追赶。
3.  **激励机制对行为有巨大影响**：说唱歌手Notorious BIG的故事揭示了激励机制对个人选择的深刻影响。当金钱的诱惑出现时，即使是梦想也可能让位于现实的利益。这提醒我们，要理解和设计合理的激励机制，以引导人们做出符合社会期望的行为。
4.  **非理性趋势可能持续超出预期**：即使是注定要失败的投机行为，也可能持续很长时间，让那些过早预测其崩溃的人遭受损失。在市场中，人们常常高估自己的理性，低估非理性因素的影响，导致误判和投资失败。
5.  **每个目标都有容易被忽视的负面影响**：复明妇女的故事揭示了，即使是看似美好的目标，也可能带来意想不到的负面后果。在追求任何目标之前，都需要全面评估其潜在的代价和风险，避免因为追求一个目标而失去其他重要的东西。

Thirty-seven thousand Americans died in car accidents in 1955, six times today’s rate adjusted for miles driven.

Ford began offering seat belts in every model that year. It was a $27 upgrade, equivalent to about $190 today. Research showed they reduced traffic fatalities by nearly 70%.

But only 2% of customers opted for the upgrade. Ninety-eight percent of buyers preferred to remain at the mercy of inertia.

Things eventually changed, but it took decades. Seatbelt usage [was still under 15%](https://crashstats.nhtsa.dot.gov/Api/Public/ViewPublication/810962) in the early 1980s. It didn’t exceed 80% until the early 2000s – almost half a century after Ford offered them in all cars.

It’s easy to underestimate how social norms stall change, even when the change is an obvious improvement. One of the strongest forces in the world is the urge to keep doing things as you’ve always done them, because people don’t like to be told they’ve been doing things wrong. Change eventually comes, but [agonizingly slower than you might assume](https://collabfund.com/blog/when-you-change-the-world-and-no-one-notices/).

Dunkirk was a miracle. More than 330,000 Allied soldiers, pinned down by Nazi attacks, were successfully evacuated from the beaches of France back to England, ferried by hundreds of small civilian boats.

London broke out in celebration when the mission was completed. Few were more relieved than Winston Churchill, who feared the imminent destruction of his army.

But Edmund Ironside, commander of British Home Forces, pointed out that if the Allies could quickly ferry a third of a million troops from France to England while avoiding aerial attack, the Germans probably could, too. Churchill had been holding onto hope that Germany couldn’t cross the Channel with an invasion force; such a daring mission seemed impossible. But then his own army proved it was quite possible. Dunkirk was both a success and a foreboding.

Your competitors can probably innovate and execute as well as you can. So every time you uncover a new talent you’re proud of, temper your thrill with the acceptance that other people who want to win as badly as you probably aren’t far behind.

Notorious BIG once casually mentioned that he began selling crack in fourth grade. He explained:

> They \[teachers\] was always like, “Take the talent that you have and think of something that you can do in the future with it.”
> 
> And I was like, “Well, I like to draw.” So what could I do with drawing? What am I gonna be, an art dealer? I’m not gonna be that type. I was thinking maybe I can do big billboards and shit. Like commercial art.
> 
> And then after that I got introduced to crack. Haha, now I’m thinking, commercial art?! Haha. I’m out here for 20 minutes and I can make some real, real money, man.

Incentives drive everything, and most of us underestimate what we’d be willing to do if the incentives were right.

When Barack Obama discussed running for president in 2005, his friend George Haywood – an accomplished investor – gave him a warning: the housing market was about to collapse, and would take the economy down with it.

George told Obama how mortgage-backed securities worked, how they were being rated all wrong, how much risk was piling up, and how inevitable its collapse was. And it wasn’t just talk: George was short the mortgage market.

Home prices kept rising for two years. By 2007, when cracks began showing, Obama checked in with George. Surely his bet was now paying off?

Obama wrote in his memoir:

> George told me that he had been forced to abandon his short position after taking heavy losses.
> 
> “I just don’t have enough cash to stay with the bet,” he said calmly enough, adding, “Apparently I’ve underestimated how willing people are to maintain a charade.”

Irrational trends rarely follow rational timelines. Unsustainable things can last longer than you think.

When the Black Death plague entered England in 1348, the Scots up north laughed at their good fortune. With the English crippled by disease, now was a perfect time for Scotland to stage an attack on its neighbor.

The Scots huddled together thousands of troops in preparation for battle. Which, of course, is the worst possible move during a pandemic.

“Before they could move, the savage mortality fell upon them too, scattering some in death and the rest in panic,” historian Barbara Tuchman writes in her book _A Distant Mirror_.

There’s a powerful urge to think risk is something that happens to other people. Other people get unlucky, other people make dumb decisions, other people get swayed by the seduction of greed and fear. But _you_? _Me_? No, never us. False confidence makes the eventual reality all the more shocking.

Some are more susceptible to risk than others, but no one is exempt from being humbled.

Dr. Dan Goodman once performed surgery on a middle-aged woman whose cataract had left her blind since childhood. The cataract was removed, leaving the woman with near-perfect vision. A miraculous success.

The patient returned for a checkup a few weeks later. The book _Crashing Through_ writes:

> Her reaction startled Goodman. She had been happy and content as a blind person. Now sighted, she became anxious and depressed. She told him that she had spent her adult life on welfare and had never worked, married, or ventured far from home – a small existence to which she had become comfortably accustomed. Now, however, government officials told her that she no longer qualified for disability, and they expected her to get a job. Society wanted her to function normally. It was, she told Goldman, too much to handle.

Every goal you dream about has a downside that’s easy to overlook.

Historian John Meecham writes:

> When we condemn \[the past\] for slavery, or for Native American removal, or for denying women their full role in the life of the nation, we ought to pause and think: What injustices are we perpetuating even now that will one day face the harshest of verdicts by those who come after us?

This applies to so many things.

What is the modern version of cigarettes, which were doctor-recommended just a few generations ago? We didn’t know dinosaurs existed 200 years ago, which makes you wonder what else is out there that we’re oblivious to today. What company is the modern Enron, so obviously a fraud? What do most people – not a few wackos, but most of us – believe that will look something between hilarious and disgraceful 100 years from now?

A lot of history is just gawking at how wrong, how blind, people can be. Disastrously wrong, embarrassingly blind. Millions of people, all at the same time. When you then realize that today will be considered history in a few generations … oh dear. It’s unpleasant. But also fascinating.

Apollo 11 was the first time in history humans visited another celestial body.

You’d think that would be an overwhelming experience – literally the coolest thing any human had ever done. But as the spacecraft hovered over the moon, Michael Collins turned to Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin and said:

> It’s amazing how quickly you adapt. It doesn’t seem weird at all to me to look out there and see the moon going by, you know?

Three months later, after Al Bean walked on the moon during Apollo 12, he turned to astronaut Pete Conrad and said “It’s kind of like the song: _Is that all there is?_” Conrad was relieved, because he secretly felt the same, describing his moonwalk as spectacular but not momentous.

Most mental upside comes from the thrill of anticipation – actual experiences tend to fall flat, and your mind quickly moves on to anticipating the next event. That’s how dopamine works.

If walking on the moon left astronauts underwhelmed, what does it say about our own earthly goals and expectations?

John Nash is one of the smartest mathematicians to ever live, winning the Nobel Prize. He was also schizophrenic, and spent most of his life convinced that aliens were sending him coded messages.

In her book _A Beautiful Mind_, Silvia Nasar recounts a conversation between Nash and Harvard professor George Mackey:

> “How could you, a mathematician, a man devoted to reason and logical proof, how could you believe that extraterrestrials are sending you messages? How could you believe that you are being recruited by aliens from outer space to save the world?” Mackey asked.
> 
> “Because,” Nash said slowly in his soft, reasonable southern drawl, “the ideas I had about supernatural beings came to me the same way that my mathematical ideas did. So I took them seriously.”

This is a good example of a theory I have about very talented people: No one should be shocked when people who think about the world in unique ways you like also think about the world in unique ways you don’t like. Unique minds have to be accepted as a full package.
