## Summary
**摘要**：
作者分享了一些关于早期计算机和互联网文化历史的链接，这些链接帮助作者重新体验了那些塑造其计算机和互联网使用经历的时代。作者推荐了Richard MacManus的Cybercultural网站，该网站记录了Web从杂志到新型媒介的转变过程，并特别提到了关于GeoCities的文章。此外，作者还推荐了Jay Hoffman的The History of the Web，通过时间线浏览可以发现许多关于Perl和Python以及早期在线出版的有趣文章。Folklore网站则讲述了Apple Macintosh的开发轶事。Aaron A. Read的50 Years of Text Games深入探讨了文本游戏的历史及其对计算机文化的影响。最后，作者还推荐了Benj Edwards的文章，他是一位科技记者和游戏历史学家，他的文章涵盖了从Myst游戏到早期汽车导航系统等各种主题。作者因为早期互联网将计算机从军事、商业和学术领域带入生活各个方面而喜欢它，并对那些未被探索的早期技术和文化现象充满兴趣。

**要点总结**：
1.  **Cybercultural网站记录了Web的转型**：该网站由Richard MacManus创立，他曾编辑ReadWriteWeb，记录了Web从传统媒体形式转变为以人和注意力为核心的新型媒介的过程。GeoCities的文章展示了早期互联网为用户创造“家”的感觉的努力。

3.  **Folklore网站分享了Apple Macintosh的开发轶事**：该网站收集了关于Apple Macintosh开发过程中的各种趣闻轶事，例如“Mister Macintosh”的创意和圆角矩形UI设计的起源。
4.  **50 Years of Text Games项目探讨了文本游戏的历史与文化影响**：Aaron A. Read的项目通过回顾每年的文本游戏，展示了计算机文化的发展，并推荐了关于LamdaMOO和Universal Paperclips等游戏的文章，探讨了多人在线游戏的社交结构和AI主题。
5.  **Benj Edwards的文章涵盖了广泛的科技历史主题**：作为一名科技记者和游戏历史学家，Edwards撰写了关于Myst游戏、Etak早期汽车导航系统等主题的深度文章，展现了科技发展的不同方面。

Markdown Content:
My formative experiences of computing and the internet are now regarded as “history” haha

Which is BRILLIANT because I get to experience them all again, only via people who are doing the work to actually document and interpret it.

_So, some links!_

* * *

**[Cybercultural](https://cybercultural.com/)** is by Richard MacManus who founded and edited _ReadWriteWeb_ from 2003–2012. This was the period in which we all figured out that the web wasn’t a magazine, or a shop, or a TV, but a new kind of medium, with people and attention as the matter and energy of its physics. Anyway, he knows what he’s talking about, that’s what I mean.

I loved [GeoCities in 1995: Building a Home Page on the Internet](https://cybercultural.com/p/geocities-1995/) which has screenshots I’ve never seen, and the origin story of how and why\_ they wanted to give people the sense that they had a _home_ on the internet.

* * *

**[The History of the Web](https://thehistoryoftheweb.com/)** by Jay Hoffman and updates twice monthly (you can get a newsletter). I’ve found the best way to explore is to scroll down the [timeline](https://thehistoryoftheweb.com/timeline/) and click on articles as you see them.

This history of Perl and Python, [The Linguist and the Programmer](https://thehistoryoftheweb.com/imdb-and-internet-underground-music-archive/), brought back so many memories. (And made remember hanging out on the perl usenet back in the day… [Abigail](https://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=50291)!)

Then these two articles about early online publishing:

*   [Salon, Slate, and a History of the Tricky Business of Publishing Online](https://thehistoryoftheweb.com/salon-vs-slate/)
*   [The Web After Suck](https://thehistoryoftheweb.com/the-web-after-suck/)

What I really appreciate about Hoffman’s writing is that there are many, many links in the _Sources_ section for these articles. Thank you!

* * *

**[Folklore](https://folklore.org/)** is an older project and still a great one: Anecdotes about the development of Apple’s original Macintosh, and the people who made it.

I love reading about [Mister Macintosh](https://folklore.org/Mister_Macintosh.html), a weird dumb idea (all the best ones are). From Steve Jobs:

> Mr. Macintosh is a mysterious little man who lives inside each Macintosh. He pops up every once in a while, when you least expect it, and then winks at you and disappears again. It will be so quick that you won’t be sure if you saw him or not. We’ll plant references in the manuals to the legend of Mr. Macintosh, and no one will know if he’s real or not. …
> 
> One out of every thousand or two times that you pull down a menu, instead of the normal commands, you’ll get Mr. Macintosh, leaning against the wall of the menu.

Then you get the [Roll Your Own Calculator Construction Set](https://folklore.org/Calculator_Construction_Set.html) and the [origin story of rounded rectangles](https://folklore.org/Round_Rects_Are_Everywhere.html).

* * *

**[50 Years of Text Games](https://if50.substack.com/)** by Aaron A. Read was originally a Substack and you can still read it there: A deep dive into text game history, from The Oregon Trail to A.I. Dungeon. One per year.

It’s more than that: it’s a lens to see the culture around computing over two important generations.

Every piece in the [archive](https://if50.substack.com/archive) is gold. Two faves are [1990: LamdaMOO](https://if50.substack.com/p/1990-lambdamoo) about multiplayer, co-created text gaming… and the social structures they had to discover. (Also the subject of the amazing and prescient [My Tiny Life](http://www.juliandibbell.com/texts/mytinylife.html) (1998) by Julian Dibbell, [which I mention here](https://interconnected.org/home/2022/10/10/servers).)

And [2017: Universal Paperclips](https://if50.substack.com/p/2017-universal-paperclips) about a super-intelligent AI that makes paperclips…

[Buy the 50 Years of Text Games book](https://if50.textories.com/). I own it. 100% worth getting a copy.

**[Benj Edwards](https://www.benjedwards.com/),** literally anything written by him. Not a project but a person, Edwards is a tech journalist and video game/tech historian. So go [browse his archive of deep-dives](https://www.benjedwards.com/works.php) and [also on Ars Technica](https://arstechnica.com/author/benjedwards/).

I really enjoyed [Myst at 25: How it changed gaming, created addicts, and made enemies](https://www.fastcompany.com/90240345/myst-at-25-how-it-changed-gaming-created-addicts-and-made-enemies) (and also it reminded me about _Leisure Suit Larry…_ what an era).

This is a classic: [Who Needs GPS? The Forgotten Story of Etak’s Amazing 1985 Car Navigation System](https://www.fastcompany.com/3047828/who-needs-gps-the-forgotten-story-of-etaks-amazing-1985-car-navigation-system) – how do you build satnav with no satellites? In other articles Edwards extended the story to the earlier video games and to Google Maps; [I connected the dots here](https://interconnected.org/home/2024/05/17/arrow).

So from time to time [I lecture on folktales from early computing](https://www.actsnotfacts.com/made/folktales). _(A highlight was doing the whole 3 x 1 hour series on successive nights at a tech conference. Evening entertainment!)_

The reason I love the early web - outside my usual period - is because (a) I was there, a little bit, and (b) it’s when computing stopped being primarily about the military, and business, and academia and became just about… life.

Let’s define the period as the [September that never ended](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_September) and everything after: in 1993/94, commercial ISPs got people online en masse, and the flood of newbs couldn’t be absorbed by existing cyberculture. In previous Septembers, students in the new academic year had netiquette beaten into them eventually but… so we’re the visigoths that trashed Rome. I love it.

But mainly, (c), this reason: we were all still figuring it out.

So there are all these roads not taken that are none-the-less fascinating, and I use them as references _all the time_ in my work and I would love to dig deeper, and discover what I missed at the time.

i.e. I would love to follow along if you have a history project that hits on [Kai’s Power Tools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kai%27s_Power_Tools) or [SmarterChild](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SmarterChild) or [Taligent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taligent) or [net.art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net.art) or… you know what I mean. lmk?
