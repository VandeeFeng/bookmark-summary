## Summary
**摘要**：
《牛津年度词汇》于2024年由牛津大学出版社揭晓，该年度词汇为“脑腐”。“脑腐”的定义指的是“被认为是因过度消费被认为低质量或乏味的在线内容而导致的个人智力或精神状态的衰弱，特别是作为一种观点，认为这种衰弱是因过度消费而在社交媒体上较为流行的在线内容。也使用于描述某些性质导致这种衰弱的物品或现象。”

2024年，“脑腐”因其新词的流行度和对此现象的广泛关注而被选为牛津年度词汇。在2023年到2024年期间，“脑腐”的使用频率增加了230%。最早在1854年，美国作家霍勒斯·格里利·伯奇的《瓦尔登湖》中提到“脑腐”这一概念，伯奇以朴素的生活方式移居自然世界，并探讨了现代社会对复杂观点和多义观点的贬低问题，他指出这种趋势反映出一个整体的思想和智力的衰退。

随着网络文化的兴起，特别是近一年里在社交媒体上，尤其是TikTok平台，出现了大量针对青少年群体的关心“网络过度消费”带来的潜在负面影响的讨论。通常，人们认为大量恶搞和憨态成分的网络内容可能会对个人的身心健康，尤其是对青少年带来负面影响。例如，一条有着数百万点击量的苏维埃列车小便视频，以及“在俄亥俄”这种针对俄亥俄州某些愚蠢事件的用户生成的梗图片。

“脑腐”不仅象征着导致这种状况的网络内容，还包括对青少年使用者而言可能出现的一种深层次的心理影响问题。即便是知名度更低的网络内容，也有可能被年轻人定义为“脑腐”的，比如某些在TikTok流行的网络词汇，涉及到诸如“苏比”这类特定的网络语言，用来概述令人难以理解的、无意义的内容，以及以俄亥俄州相关事件作为标签的夸张网络内容。

更重要的是，网络文化中涌现出一种新的语言和表达，这种语言往往在网络上先行流行，随后对日常生活的影响颇为深远，但由于它与现实生活之间的揭秘并不一致。

牛津大学出版社总裁卡斯珀·格拉沃尔就此年词汇的选择与《牛津年度词汇》的过去两个十年的历史变化做了这样的评论：

“看到世界各地语言爱好者参与到决定2024年牛津年度词汇的决定中，很有启发，也充满了深意。回归过去的《牛津年度词汇》，可以显现出我们不断演变的虚拟生活，网络文化对我们是谁这一身份的影响和描绘景观的广泛程度。获奖词汇‘inness’，展示了语言如何被各种类型的社会活动集体塑造并发明，有趣的是词义最终会超出其缔造者的想象和期望，从网络社区扩展到实际世界。

**要点总结**：
> 1. **“脑腐”的定义和起源与演化**：从霍勒斯·格里利·伯奇笔下的纯真到当代社交媒体，定义突显低质量、乏味内容对精神和智力的长远影响。它是指伴随社交媒体流行的文化现象，被视为人们过度消费不当内容的后果。
>
> 2. **术语的使用和普及**：“脑腐”被广泛应用于表示丰富的网络词汇与实体文化及社会现象的交叉。这不仅包括针对社交媒体内容的定义，还涵盖了一种网络文化独特的语言魔法及新兴词汇，如“苏比”表达意思模糊的网络用语，以及以俄亥俄事件为原型的艺术表现形式。
>
> 3. **对青少年心理健康的影响**：“脑腐”与广泛担忧的网络消费过度与心理问题联系起来，特别是针对青少年个体。这种现象象征着网络文化的负效应，突出集中在对青少年身心健康消极影响的担忧。
>
> 4. **术语对象的群体特指**：“脑腐”不再仅仅作为网络文化表达，这类术语受到年轻一代（Gen Z和Gen Alpha）的强烈支持，并在社交媒体上获得关注和讨论。这表明年轻一代对网络影响的高层次认知、自我反省及对累积网络文化的负面转变的担忧。
>
> 5. **年度词汇的选择与文化演变**：该年度词汇选中的过程展示了社交媒体与现实生活之间在词汇、文化和关系上的相互影响，以及对网络文化社群结构的观察与反思。它代表了网络变迁的持续关注，网络文化的自我建设过程，以及对人类与数字生活交汇点的深入探索。

Following a public vote in which more than 37,000 people had their say, we’re pleased to announce that the Oxford Word of the Year for 2024 is ‘brain rot’.

Our language experts created a shortlist of six words to reflect the moods and conversations that have helped shape the past year. After two weeks of public voting and widespread conversation, our experts came together to consider the public’s input, voting results, and our language data, before declaring ‘brain rot’ as the definitive Word of the Year for 2024.

### **Why ‘brain rot’?**

‘Brain rot’ is defined as “the supposed deterioration of a person’s mental or intellectual state, especially viewed as the result of overconsumption of material (now particularly online content) considered to be trivial or unchallenging. Also: something characterized as likely to lead to such deterioration”.

Our experts noticed that ‘brain rot’ gained new prominence this year as a term used to capture concerns about the impact of consuming excessive amounts of low-quality online content, especially on social media. The term increased in usage frequency by 230% between 2023 and 2024.

The first recorded use of ‘brain rot’ was found in 1854 in Henry David Thoreau’s book _Walden_, which reports his experiences of living a simple lifestyle in the natural world. As part of his conclusions, Thoreau criticizes society’s tendency to devalue complex ideas, or those that can be interpreted in multiple ways, in favour of simple ones, and sees this as indicative of a general decline in mental and intellectual effort: _“While England endeavours to cure the potato rot, will not any endeavour to cure the brain-rot – which prevails so much more widely and fatally?”_

The term has taken on new significance in the digital age, especially over the past 12 months. Initially gaining traction on social media platform—particularly on TikTok among Gen Z and Gen Alpha communities—’brain rot’ is now seeing more widespread use, such as in mainstream journalism, amidst societal concerns about the negative impact of overconsuming online content.

In 2024, ‘brain rot’ is used to describe both the cause and effect of this, referring to low-quality, low-value content found on social media and the internet, as well as the subsequent negative impact that consuming this type of content is perceived to have on an individual or society.

It has also been used more specifically and consistently in reference to online culture. Often used in a humorous or self-deprecating manner by online communities, it is strongly associated with certain types of content—including creator Alexey Gerasimov’s viral _Skibidi Toilet_ video series, featuring humanoid toilets, and user-generated ‘only in Ohio’ memes, which reference bizarre incidents in the state. This content has given rise to emerging ‘brain rot language’—such as ‘skibidi’, meaning something nonsensical, and ‘Ohio’, meaning something embarrassing or weird—which reflects a growing trend of words originating in viral online culture before spreading offline into the ‘real world’.

Now also gaining momentum is a broader, more serious conversation about the potential negative impact that excessively consuming this content might have on mental health, particularly in children and young people. Earlier this year, [a mental health centre](https://www.newportinstitute.com/resources/co-occurring-disorders/brain-rot/#:~:text=Brain%20rot%20is%20a%20condition,negative%20and%20distressing%20news%20online.) in the US even published advice online about how to recognize and avoid ‘brain rot’.

Speaking about this year’s selection process and the 2024 winner, Casper Grathwohl, President of Oxford Languages, said:

_“It’s been insightful and deeply moving to see language lovers all over the world participate and help us select the Oxford Word of the Year 2024._

_“Looking back at the Oxford Word of the Year over the past two decades, you can see society’s growing preoccupation with how our virtual lives are evolving, the way internet culture is permeating so much of who we are and what we talk about. Last year’s winning word, ‘rizz’, was an interesting example of how language is increasingly formed, shaped, and shared within online communities. ‘Brain rot’ speaks to one of the perceived dangers of virtual life, and how we are using our free time. It feels like a rightful next chapter in the cultural conversation about humanity and technology. It’s not surprising that so many voters embraced the term, endorsing it as our choice this year._

_“I find it fascinating that the term ‘brain rot’ has been adopted by Gen Z and Gen Alpha, those communities largely responsible for the use and creation of the digital content the term refers to. These communities have amplified the expression through social media channels, the very place said to cause ‘brain rot’. It demonstrates a somewhat cheeky self-awareness in the younger generations about the harmful impact of social media that they’ve inherited.”_
