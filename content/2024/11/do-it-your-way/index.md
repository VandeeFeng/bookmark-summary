## Summary
**摘要**：
本文探讨了一位年轻有才华却具有大读者群体的知名作家，在加入知名媒体公司后迅速失去原创性与个性的案例。在媒体公司内部，“遵循既定风格”、“遵从管理指示”成为了动作准则。这种外在压力导致了具有艺术天赋的人不得不改变自身特质，最终变成平庸的员工。本文警醒读者反思自身处于不同环境所带来的影响。尤其是无法忽视人物的个性、背景、目标和技能差异如何影响到他们的行为决定，面对“最佳方法”问题时，不应该寻求一个适用于所有人的万能答案。而且，投资和消费风格的差异并不意味着对或错的评判，而应当尊重每个人个性化的选择，避免因他人的消费习惯影响自身，尤其是当这种差异涉及到个人的自我认同时。

**要点总结**：
1. **个性与独立性**：每个人都有自己独特的个性、背景、目标和技能，不应因追求普遍认同的最好方法而放弃个人特质。
2. **职场适应与原创性**：加入大型组织后，员工可能会失去原创性和个人风格，按照公司规范行动，从而失去专业优势和创新潜力。
3. **投资与消费的个性化**：投资或消费的习惯固不应成为模棱两可的概念判断，而是应当尊重个体的个性化选择和内在的信念与需求。
4. **自我评价与个性化目标**：在人生的每一个领域，独立地设定目标和衡量标准比盲目与他人比较更有价值，从而避免外部压力带来的不必要焦虑。
5. **追求个人满足度**：关键在于满足个人想要从生活层面实现的目标，这比外界的社会认同更重要，不应将此作为自身成功的最终衡量标准。

Do It Your Way
--------------

The ultimate success metric is whether you get what you want out of life. But that’s harder than it sounds because it’s easy to try to copy someone who wants something you don’t.

* * *

I’ve seen this play out twice: An incredibly talented young writer with a big blog following joins a major media company where they quickly fizzled into irrelevance.

It was the same story each time: When the writer was young and independent they could write with their own voice, their own style, their own flair. They could run with their own intuition.

They were artists, which was what made them great.

Then they joined a big media company, which said, “That’s not how we do things here. Here’s our style book, you must follow it to a T. And meet Gordon, he’s your new editor. He will tell you what to write and when to write it. Good day, sir.”

They became employees, which was their downfall.

And these were very successful media companies. They knew what kind of writing worked and what their readers wanted. But of course it didn’t work out. What was right for the company was wrong for the writer. A talented person can quickly become mediocre when you force them to be someone they aren’t.

Even if you’re not an entrepreneur, there’s so much to learn from that.

It’s so common to on one hand recognize how much variety there is among people – different personalities, backgrounds, goals, skills – but on the other hand ask, “What’s the best way to do this thing?” as if there can be one universal answer for vastly different people.

One area this impacts people is with money, where more damage is caused not by dumb financial plans but by reasonable ones that just aren’t right for you.

How you invest might cause me to lose sleep, and how I invest might prevent you from looking at yourself in the mirror tomorrow. Isn’t that OK? Isn’t it far better to just accept that we’re different rather than arguing over which one of us is right or wrong? And wouldn’t it be dangerous if you became persuaded to invest like me even if it’s wrong for your personality and skill set?

Or take how we spend money. You like this, I like that. Who cares? It gets dangerous when you assume that if someone else is spending their money differently they either must be doing it better than you or doing it wrong. And that’s actually very common, because it’s easy to interpret someone spending money differently than you as an attack on what you’ve chosen to spend money on.

It’s possible to be humble and learn from other people while also recognizing that the best strategy for you is the one closest aligned with your unique personality and skills.

A few things happen when you do.

**You do your best work and have the most fun** when you’re not burdened by fear that someone else thinks you’re doing it wrong.

**You measure how you’re doing against your personal benchmarks**, which can both push you to your potential and prevent you from chasing someone else’s.

**You have a much better shot of getting what you want out of life**. Which, again, is all that really matters.
