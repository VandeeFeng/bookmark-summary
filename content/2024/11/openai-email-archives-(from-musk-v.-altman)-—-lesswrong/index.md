## Summary
**摘要**：
文章记录了2015年至2019年间，Elon Musk与Sam Altman围绕创建加速AI开发的“曼哈顿计划”进行的讨论以及OpenAI实体的创建与演进过程。主要关注点包括：首次讨论建立AI的主要动机和潜在问题、AI开发的安全性、创建OpenAI LP的新实体作为混合型非盈利和盈利公司以快速增加投资与人才，同时确保实现安全的通用人工智能（AGI）并将其带来的利益与世界共享、以及开发面向开放世界的AI研究与商业策略等。

**要点总结**：
1. **AI创建的必要性与甲烷事件**：2015年，Sam Altman提议“比尔盖茨、皮埃尔奥米迪亚、戴维森·莫斯基”等关键科技人员合作，以防止AI开发落入谷歌手中，并主张“使用首批7-10位成员，构建首个通用AI，以培养个体能力（即，人类的未来版本）”。该提议得到了Elon Musk的支持。

2. **OpenAI LP的创建与哲学**：随着OpenAI实体的扩张，需要快速增加投资和利用才智，面临扩大规模与维持纯粹非盈利结构之间的冲突。因此，创建了OpenAI LP——一种混合型非盈利和盈利的实体，通过明确投资者和员工的固定收益与额外超额利益归属非盈利实体，确保目标是对齐并优先使用收入和服务推动AI目标。

3. **个人角色与决策结构**：OpenAI LP由Greg Brockman任主席和首席技术官、Ilya Sutskever任首席科学家、Sam Altman任首席执行官。董事们在冲突利益和收益分配决策上实施了强有力的控制政策，确保非营利组织的使命高于商业利益，并给投资者提供了明确的收益上限。

4. **AI研究与发展方向**：OpenAI LP聚集了约100名员工，专注于能力提升、安全性和政策三个主要领域，通过教育项目和研究活动（如学者和研究员计划）推动AI技术的发展。同时，企业强调了开发安全AGI的重要性，并对风险、业务模式和企业结构的实施进行了深入讨论。

5. **Elon Musk与OpenAI的产品差异化**：Musk与Altman就OpenAI的产品结构和特许权进行了讨论，强调了个性化研究与商业深度的平衡，以及如何获利的潜在途径，包括非核心的许可收入。此外，确保企业结构针对AI安全性的高度关注一直是二人讨论的核心点。

Markdown Content:
As part of the [court case](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/69013420/musk-v-altman/) between Elon Musk and Sam Altman, a substantial number of emails between Elon, Sam Altman, Ilya Sutskever, and Greg Brockman have been released.

I have found reading through these really valuable, and I haven't found an online source that compiles all of them in an easy to read format. So I made one.

I used some AI assistance to generate this originally, and then went meticulously through each email and checked them for differences. I am pretty sure I caught any differences, but I might have missed some very small typographical errors.[\[1\]](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/5jjk4CDnj9tA7ugxr/openai-email-archives-from-musk-v-altman#fn2d6t2g9hnl4) The original source is: [https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/69013420/musk-v-altman/](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/69013420/musk-v-altman/)

**Subject:** question
---------------------

### _**Sam Altman** to Elon Musk - May 25, 2015 9:10 PM_

Been thinking a lot about whether it's possible to stop humanity from developing AI.

I think the answer is almost definitely not.

If it's going to happen anyway, it seems like it would be good for someone other than Google to do it first.

Any thoughts on whether it would be good for YC to start a Manhattan Project for AI? My sense is we could get many of the top ~50 to work on it, and we could structure it so that the tech belongs to the world via some sort of nonprofit but the people working on it get startup-like compensation if it works. Obviously we'd comply with/aggressively support all regulation.

Sam

### _**Elon Musk** to Sam Altman - May 25, 2015 11:09 PM_

Probably worth a conversation

### _**Sam Altman** to Elon Musk - Jun 24, 2015 10:24 AM_

The mission would be to create the first general AI and use it for individual empowerment—ie, the distributed version of the future that seems the safest. More generally, safety should be a first-class requirement.

I think we’d ideally start with a group of 7-10 people, and plan to expand from there. We have a nice extra building in Mountain View they can have.

I think for a governance structure, we should start with 5 people and I’d propose you, Bill Gates, Pierre Omidyar, Dustin Moskovitz, and me. The technology would be owned by the foundation and used “for the good of the world”, and in cases where it’s not obvious how that should be applied the 5 of us would decide. The researchers would have significant financial upside but it would be uncorrelated to what they build, which should eliminate some of the conflict (we’ll pay them a competitive salary and give them YC equity for the upside). We’d have an ongoing conversation about what work should be open-sourced and what shouldn’t. At some point we’d get someone to run the team, but he/she probably shouldn’t be on the governance board.

Will you be involved somehow in addition to just governance? I think that would be really helpful for getting work pointed in the right direction getting the best people to be part of it. Ideally you’d come by and talk to them about progress once a month or whatever. We generically call people involved in some limited way in YC “part-time partners” (we do that with Peter Thiel for example, though at this point he’s very involved) but we could call it whatever you want. Even if you can’t really spend time on it but can be publicly supportive, that would still probably be really helpful for recruiting.

I think the right plan with the regulation letter is to wait for this to get going and then I can just release it with a message like “now that we are doing this, I’ve been thinking a lot about what sort of constraints the world needs for safefy.” I’m happy to leave you off as a signatory. I also suspect that after it’s out more people will be willing to get behind it.

### _**Greg Brockman** to Elon Musk, (cc: Sam Altman) - Nov 22, 2015 6:11 PM_

Hey Elon,

Nice chatting earlier.

As I mentioned on the phone, here's the latest early draft of the blog post: [https://quip.com/6YnqA26RJgKr](https://quip.com/6YnqA26RJgKr). (Sam, Ilya, and I are thinking about new names; would love any input from you.)

Obviously, there's a lot of other detail to change too, but I'm curious what you think of that kind of messaging. I don't want to pull any punches, and would feel comfortable broadcasting a stronger message if it feels right. I think it's mostly important that our messaging appeals to the research community (or at least the subset we want to hire). I hope for us to enter the field as a neutral group, looking to collaborate widely and shift the dialog towards being about humanity winning rather than any particular group or company. (I think that's the best way to bootstrap ourselves into being a leading research institution.)

I've attached the offer letter template we've been using, with a salary of $175k. Here's the email template I've been sending people:

> Attached is your official YCR offer letter! Please sign and date the your convenience. There will be two more documents coming:
> 
> *   A separate letter offering you 0.25% of each YC batch you are present for (as compensation for being an Advisor to YC).
> *   The At-Will Employment, Confidential Information, Invention Assignment and Arbitration Agreement
> 
> (As this is the first batch of official offers we've done, please forgive any bumpiness along the way, and please let me know if anything looks weird!)
> 
> We plan to offer the following benefits:
> 
> *   Health, dental, and vision insurance
> *   Unlimited vacation days with a recommendation of four weeks per year
> *   Paid parental leave
> *   Paid conference attendance when you are presenting YC AI work or asked to attend by YC AI
> 
> We're also happy to provide visa support. When you're ready to talk about visa-related questions, I'm happy to put you in touch with Kirsty from YC.
> 
> Please let me know if you have any questions — I'm available to chat any time! Looking forward to working together :).

**Subject:** Draft opening paragraphs
-------------------------------------

### _**Elon Musk** to Sam Altman - Dec 8, 2015 9:29 AM_

It is super important to get the opening summary section right. This will be what everyone reads and what the press mostly quotes. The whole point of this release is to attract top talent. Not sure Greg totally gets that.

\---- OpenAI is a non-profit artificial intelligence research company with the goal of advancing digital intelligence in the way that is most likely to benefit humanity as a whole, unencumbered by an obligation to generate financial returns.

The underlying philosophy of our company is to disseminate AI technology as broadly as possible as an extension of all individual human wills, ensuring, in the spirit of liberty, that the power of digital intelligence is not overly concentrated and evolves toward the future desired by the sum of humanity.

The outcome of this venture is uncertain and the pay is low compared to what others will offer, but we believe the goal and the structure are right. We hope this is what matters most to the best in the field.

### _**Sam Altman** to Elon Musk - Dec 8, 2015 10:34 AM_

how is this?

**Subject:** just got word...
-----------------------------

### _**Sam Altman** to Elon Musk - Dec 11, 2015 11:30AM_

that deepmind is going to give everyone in openAI massive counteroffers tomorrow to try to kill it.

do you have any objection to me proactively increasing everyone's comp by 100-200k per year? i think they're all motivated by the mission here but it would be a good signal to everyone we are going to take care of them over time.

sounds like deepmind is planning to go to war over this, they've been literally cornering people at NIPS.

### _**Elon Musk** to Sam Altman - Dec 11, 2015_

Has Ilya come back with a solid yes?

If anyone seems at all uncertain, I’m happy to call them personally too. Have told Emma this is my absolute top priority 24/7.

### _**Sam Altman** to Elon Musk - Dec 11, 2015 12:15 PM_

yes committed committed. just gave his word.

### _**Elon Musk** to Sam Altman - Dec 11, 2015 12:32 PM_

awesome

### _**Sam Altman** to Elon Musk - Dec 11, 2015 12:35 PM_

everyone feels great, saying stuff like "bring on the deepmind offers, they unfortunately dont have 'do the right thing' on their side"

### _**Elon Musk** to: Ilya Sutskever, Pamela Vagata, Vicki Cheung, Diederik Kingma, Andrej Karpathy, John D. Schulman, Trevor Blackwell, Greg Brockman, (cc:Sam Altman) - Dec 11, 2015 4:41 PM_

Congratulations on a great beginning!

We are outmanned and outgunned by a ridiculous margin by organizations you know well, but we have right on our side and that counts for a lot. I like the odds.

Our most important consideration is recruitment of the best people. The output of any company is the vector sum of the people within it. If we are able to attract the most talented people over time and our direction is correctly aligned, then OpenAI will prevail.

To this end, please give a lot of thought to who should join. If I can be helpful with recruitment or anything else, I am at your disposal. I would recommend paying close attention to people who haven't completed their grad or even undergrad, but are obviously brilliant. Better to have them join before they achieve a breakthrough.

Looking forward to working together,

Elon

**Subject:** compensation framework

### _**Greg Brockman** to Elon Musk, (cc: Sam Altman) - Feb 21, 2016 11:34 AM_

Hi all,

We're currently doing our first round of full-time offers post-founding. It's obviously super important to get these right, as the implications are very long-term. I don't yet feel comfortable making decisions here on my own, and would love any guidance.

Here's what we're currently doing:

Founding team: $275k salary + 25bps of YC stock

\- Also have option of switching permanently to $125k annual bonus or equivalent in YC or SpaceX stock. I don't know if anyone's taken us up on this.

New offers: $175k annual salary + $125k annual bonus || equivalent in YC or SpaceX stock. Bonus is subject to performance review, where you may get 0% or significantly greater than 100%.

Special cases: gdb + Ilya + Trevor

The plan is to keep a mostly flat salary, and use the bonus multiple as a way to reward strong performers.

Some notes:

\- We use a 20% annualized discount for the 8 years until the stock becomes liquid, the $125k bonus equates to 12bps in YC. So the terminal value is more like $750k. This number sounds a lot more impressive, though obviously it's hard to value exactly.

\- The founding team was initially offered $175k each. The day after the lab launched, we proactively increased everyone's salary by $100k, telling them that we are financially committed to them as the lab becomes successful, and asking for a personal promise to ignore all counteroffers and trust we'll take care of them.

\- We're currently interviewing Ian Goodfellow from Brain, who is one of the top 2 scientists in the field we don't have (the other being Alex Graves, who is a DeepMind loyalist). He's the best person on Brain, so Google will fight for him. We're grandfathering him into the founding team offer.

Some salary datapoints:

\- John was offered $250k all-in annualized at DeepMind, thought he could negotiate to $300k easily.

\- Wojciech was verbally offered ~$1.25M/year at FAIR (no concrete letter though)

\- Andrew Tulloch is getting $800k/year at FB. (A lot is stock which is vesting.)

\- Ian Goodfellow is currently getting $165k cash + $600k stock/year at Google.

\- Apple is a bit desperate and offering people $550k cash (plus stock, presumably). I don't think anyone good is saying yes.

Two concrete candidates that are on my mind:

\- Andrew is very close to saying yes. However, he's concerned about taking such a large paycut.

\- Ian has stated he's not primarily concerned with money, but the Bay Area is expensive / wants to make sure he can buy a house. I don't know what will happen if/when Google starts throwing around the numbers they threw at Ilya.

My immediate questions:

1\. I expect Andrew will try to negotiate up. Should we stick to his offer, and tell him to only join if he's excited enough to take that kind of paycut (and that others have left more behind)?

2\. Ian will be interviewing + (I'm sure) getting an offer on Wednesday. Should we consider his offer final, or be willing to slide depending on what Google offers?

3\. Depending on the answers to 1 + 2, I'm wondering if this flat strategy makes sense. If we keep it, I feel we'll have to really sell people on the bonus multiplier. Maybe one option would be using a signing bonus as a lever to get people to sign?

4\. Very secondary, but our intern comp is also below market: $9k/mo. (FB offers $9k + free housing, Google offers like $11k/mo all-in.) Comp is much less important to interns than to FT people, since the experience is primary. But I think we may have lost a candidate who was on the edge to this. Given the dollar/hour is so much lower than for FT, should we consider increasing the amount?

I'm happy to chat about this at any time.

### _**Elon Musk** to Greg Brockman, (cc: Sam Altman) - Feb 22, 2016 12:09 AM_

We need to do what it takes to get the top talent. Let's go higher. If, at some point, we need to revisit what existing people are getting paid, that's fine.

Either we get the best people in the world or we will get whipped by Deepmind.

Whatever it takes to bring on ace talent is fine by me.

Deepmind is causing me extreme mental stress. If they win, it will be really bad news with their one mind to rule the world philosophy. They are obviously making major progress and well they should, given the talent level over there.

### _**Greg Brockman** to Elon Musk, (cc: Sam Altman) - Feb 22, 2016 12:21 AM_

Read you loud and clear. Sounds like a plan. Will plan to continue working with sama on specifics, but let me know if you'd like to be kept in the loop.

**Subject:** wired article
--------------------------

### _**Greg Brockman** to Elon Musk, (cc: Sam Teller) - Mar 21, 2016 12:53 AM_

Hi Elon,

I was interviewed for a Wired article on OpenAI, and the fact checker sent me some questions. Wanted to sync with you on two in particular to make sure they sound reasonable / aligned with what what you'd say:

> Would it be accurate to say that OpenAI is giving away ALL of its research?

At any given time, we will take the action that is likely to most strongly benefit the world. In the short term, we believe the best approach is giving away our research. But longer-term, this might not be the best approach: for example, it might be better not to immediately share a potentially dangerous technology. In all cases, we will be giving away all the benefits of all of our research, and want those to accrue to the world rather than any one institution.

> Does OpenAI believe that getting the most sophisticated AI possible in as many hands as possible is humanity's best chance at preventing a too-smart AI in private hands that could find a way to unleash itself on the world for malicious ends?

We believe that using AI to extend individual human wills is the most promising path to ensuring AI remains beneficial. This is appealing because if there are many agents with about the same capabilities they could keep any one bad actor in check. But I wouldn't claim we have all the answers: instead, we're building an organization that can both seek those answers, and take the best possible action regardless of what the answer turns out to be.

Thanks!

### _**Sam Teller** received this email from Alex Thompson and forwards it to Elon Musk - April 27, 2016 7:25 AM_

_Hi Sam,_

_I hope you are having a great day and I apologize for interrupting it with another question. Maureen wanted to see if Mr. Musk had any reaction to some of Mr. Zuckerberg's public comments since their interview. In particular, his labelling of Mr. Musk as "hysterical" for his A.I. fears and lectured those who "fearmonger" about the dangers of A.I.. I have included more details below of Mr. Zuckerberg's comments._

_Asked in Germany recently about Musk’s forebodings, Zuckerberg called them “hysterical’’ and praised A.I. breakthroughs, including one system he claims can make cancer diagnoses for skin lesions on a mobile phone with the accuracy of “the best dermatologist.’’_

_“Unless we really mess something up,’’ he said, the machines will always be subservient, not “superhuman.”_

_“I think we can build A.I. so it works for us and helps us...Some people fearmonger about how A.I. is a huge danger, but that seems farfetched to me and much less likely than disasters due to widespread disease, violence, etc.’’ Or as he put his philosophy at an April Facebook developers conference: “Choose hope over fear.’’_

History unequivocally illustrates that a powerful technology is a double-edged sword. It would be foolish to assume that AI, arguably the most powerful of all technologies, only has a single edge.

The recent example of Microsoft's AI chatbot shows how quickly it can turn incredibly negative. The wise course of action is to approach the advent of AI with caution and ensure that its power is widely distributed and not controlled by any one company or person.

That is why we created OpenAI.

**Subject:** MSFT hosting deal
------------------------------

### _**Sam Altman** to Elon Musk, (cc: Sam Teller) - Sep 16, 2016 2:37 PM_

Here are the MSFT terms. $60MM of compute for $10MM, and input from us on what they deploy in the cloud. LMK if you have any feedback.

### _**Elon Musk** to Sam Altman, (cc: Sam Teller) - Sep 16, 2016 3:10 PM_

This actually made me feel nauseous. It sucks and is exactly what I would expect from them.

> _**Evaluation, Evangelization, and Usage of CNTK v2, Azure Batch and HD-Insight:** OpenAI will evaluate CNTK v2, Azure Batch, and HD-Insight for their research, provide feedback on how Microsoft can improve these products.

Let’s just say that we are willing to have Microsoft donate spare computing time to OpenAI and have that be known, but we want do any contract or agree to “evangelize”. They can turn us off at any time and we can leave at any time.

### _**Sam Altman** to Elon Musk, (cc: Sam Teller) - Sep 16, 2016 3:33 PM_

I had the same reaction after reading that section and they've already agreed to drop.

We had originally just wanted space cycles donated but the team wanted more certainty that capacity will be available. But I'll work with MSFT to make sure there are no strings attached

### _**Elon Musk** to Sam Altman, (cc: Sam Teller) - Sep 16, 2016_

We should just do this low key. No certainty either way. No contract.

### _**Sam Altman** to Elon Musk, (cc: Sam Teller) - Sep 16, 2016 6:45 PM_

ok will see how much $ I can get in that direction.

### _**Sam Teller** to Elon Musk - Sep 20, 2016 8:05 PM_

Microsoft is now willing to do the agreement for a full $50m with “good faith effort at OpenAI's sole discretion” and full mutual termination rights at any time. No evangelizing. No strings attached. No looking like lame Microsoft marketing pawns. Ok to move ahead?

### _**Elon Musk** to Sam Teller - Sep 21, 2016 12:09 AM_

Fine by me if they don't use this in active messaging. Would be worth way more than $50M not to seem like Microsoft's marketing bitch.

Elon,

As I'd mentioned, Greg had asked to talk through a few things this weekend. Ilya ended up joining, and they pretty much just shared all of what they are still trying to think through. This is the distillation of that random walk of a conversation... came down to 7 unanswered questions with their commentary below. Please note that I'm not advocating for any of this, just structuring and sharing the information I heard.

**1\. Short-term control structure?**

\-Is the requirement for absolute control? They wonder if there is a scenario where there could be some sort of creative overrule provision if literally everyone else disagreed on direction (not just the three of them, but perhaps a broader board)?

**2\. Duration of control and transition?**

\-\*The\* non-negotiable seems to be an ironclad agreement to not have any one person have absolute control of AGI if it's created. Satisfying this means a situation where, regardless of what happens to the three of them, it's guaranteed that power over the company is distributed after the 2-3 year initial period.

**3\. Time spent?**

\-How much time does Elon want to spend on this, and how much time can he actually afford to spend on this? In what timeframe? Is this an hour a week, ten hours a week, something in between?

**4\. What to do with time spent?**

\-They don't really know how he prefers to spend time at his other companies and how he'd want to spend his time on this. Greg and Ilya are confident they could build out SW / ML side of things pretty well. They are not confident on the hardware front. They seemed hopeful Elon could spend some time on that since that's where they are weak, but did want his help in all domains he was interested in.

**5\. Ratio of time spent to amount of control?**

\-They are cool with less time / less control, more time / more control, but not less time / more control. Their fear is that there won't be enough time to discuss relevant contextual information to make correct decisions if too little time is spent.

**6\. Equity split?**

\-Greg still instinctually anchored on equal split. I personally disagree with him on that instinct and he asked for and was receptive to hearing other things he could use to recalibrate his mental model.

\-Greg noted that Ilya in some ways has contributed millions by leaving his earning potential on the table at Google.

\-One concern they had was the proposed employee pool was too small.

**7\. Capitalization strategy?**

\-Their instinct is to raise much more than $100M out of the gate. They are of the opinion that the datacenter they need alone would cost that so they feel more comfortable raising more.

**Takeaways:**

Unsure if any of this is amenable but just from listening to all of the data points they threw out, the following would satisfy their current sticky points:

\-Spending 5-10 hours a week with near full control, or spend less time and have less control.

\-Having a creative short-term override just for extreme scenarios that was not just Greg / Sam / Ilya.

\-An ironclad 2-3yr minority control agreement, regardless of the fates of Greg / Sam / Ilya.

\-$200M-$1B initial raise.

\-Greg and Ilya's stakes end up higher than 1/10 of Elon's but not significantly (this remains the most ambiguous).

\-Increasing employee pool.

**Subject:** Honest Thoughts
----------------------------

### _**Ilya Sutskever** to Elon Musk, Sam Altman, (cc: Greg Brockman, Sam Teller, Shivon Zilis) - Sep 20, 2017 2:08 PM_

Elon, Sam,

This process has been the highest stakes conversation that Greg and I have ever participated in, and if the project succeeds, it'll turn out to have been the highest stakes conversation the world has seen. It's also been a deeply personal conversation for all of us.

Yesterday while we were considering making our final commitment given the non-solicit agreement, we realized we'd made a mistake. We have several important concerns that we haven't raised with either of you. We didn't raise them because we were afraid to: we were afraid of harming the relationship, having you think less of us, or losing you as partners.

There is some chance that our concerns will prove to be unresolvable. We really hope it's not the case, but we know we will fail for sure if we don't all discuss them now. And we have hope that we can work through them and all continue working together.

Elon:

We really want to work with you. We believe that if we join forces, our chance of success in the mission is the greatest. Our upside is the highest. There is no doubt about that. Our desire to work with you is so great that we are happy to give up on the equity, personal control, make ourselves easily firable — whatever it takes to work with you.

But we realized that we were careless in our thinking about the implications of control for the world. Because it seemed so hubristic, we have not been seriously considering the implications of success.

The current structure provides you with a path where you end up with unilateral absolute control over the AGI. You stated that you don't want to control the final AGI, but during this negotiation, you've shown to us that absolute control is extremely important to you.

As an example, you said that you needed to be CEO of the new company so that everyone will know that you are the one who is in charge, even though you also stated that you hate being CEO and would much rather not be CEO.

Thus, we are concerned that as the company makes genuine progress towards AGI, you will choose to retain your absolute control of the company despite current intent to the contrary. We disagree with your statement that our ability to leave is our greatest power, because once the company is actually on track to AGI, the company will be much more important than any individual.

The goal of OpenAI is to make the future good and to avoid an AGI dictatorship. You are concerned that Demis could create an AGI dictatorship. So do we. So it is a bad idea to create a structure where you could become a dictator if you chose to, especially given that we can create some other structure that avoids this possibility.

We have a few smaller concerns, but we think it's useful to mention it here:

In the event we decide to buy Cerebras, my strong sense is that it'll be done through Tesla. But why do it this way if we could also do it from within OpenAI? Specifically, the concern is that Tesla has a duty to shareholders to maximize shareholder return, which is not aligned with OpenAI's mission. So the overall result may not end up being optimal for OpenAI.

We believe that OpenAI the non-profit was successful because both you and Sam were in it. Sam acted as a genuine counterbalance to you, which has been extremely fruitful. Greg and I, at least so far, are much worse at being a counterbalance to you. We feel this is evidenced even by this negotiation, where we were ready to sweep the long-term AGI control questions under the rug while Sam stood his ground.

Sam:

When Greg and I are stuck, you've always had an answer that turned out to be deep and correct. You've been thinking about the ways forward on this problem extremely deeply and thoroughly. Greg and I understand technical execution, but we don't know how structure decisions will play out over the next month, year, or five years.

But we haven't been able to fully trust your judgements throughout this process, because we don't understand your cost function.

We don't understand why the CEO title is so important to you. Your stated reasons have changed, and it's hard to really understand what's driving it.

Is AGI truly your primary motivation? How does it connect to your political goals? How has your thought process changed over time?

Greg and Ilya:

We had a fair share of our own failings during this negotiation, and we'll list some of them here (Elon and Sam, I'm sure you'll have plenty to add...):

During this negotiation, we realized that we have allowed the idea of financial return 2-3 years down the line to drive our decisions. This is why we didn't push on the control — we thought that our equity is good enough, so why worry? But this attitude is wrong, just like the attitude of AI experts who don't think that AI safety is an issue because they don't really believe that they'll build AGI.

We did not speak our full truth during the negotiation. We have our excuses, but it was damaging to the process, and we may lose both Sam and Elon as a result.

There's enough baggage here that we think it's very important for us to meet and talk it out. Our collaboration will not succeed if we don't. Can all four of us meet today? If all of us say the truth, and resolve the issues, the company that we'll create will be much more likely to withstand the very strong forces it'll experience.

\- Greg & Ilya

Guys, I've had enough. This is the final straw. Either go do something on your own or continue with OpenAI as a nonprofit. I will no longer fund OpenAI until you have made a firm commitment to stay or I'm just being a fool who is essentially providing free funding for you to create a startup. Discussions are over

Hi Elon,

Quick FYI that Greg and Ilya said they would like to continue with the non-profit structure. They know they would need to provide a guarantee that they won't go off doing something else to make it work.

Haven't spoken to Altman yet but he asked to talk this afternoon so will report anything I hear back.

If anything I can do to help let me know.

### _**Elon Musk** to Shivon Zilis (cc: Sam Teller) - Sep 22, 2017 10:01 AM_

Ok

### _**Shivon Zilis** to Elon Musk, (cc: Sam Teller) - Sep 22, 2017 5:54 PM_

From Altman:

**Structure:** Great with keeping non-profit and continuing to support it.

**Trust:** Admitted that he lost a lot of trust with Greg and Ilya through this process. Felt their messaging was inconsistent and felt childish at times.

**Hiatus:** Sam told Greg and Ilya he needs to step away for 10 days to think. Needs to figure out how much he can trust them and how much he wants to work with them. Said he will come back after that and figure out how much time he wants to spend.

**Fundraising:** Greg and Ilya have the belief that 100's of millions can be achieved with donations if there is a definitive effort. Sam thinks there is a definite path to 10's of millions but TBD on more. He did mention that Holden was irked by the move to for-profit and potentially offered more substantial amount of money if OpenAI stayed a non-profit, but hasn't firmly committed. Sam threw out a $100M figure for this if it were to happen.

**Communications:** Sam was bothered by how much Greg and Ilya keep the whole team in the loop with happenings as the process unfolded. Felt like it distracted the team. On the other hand, apparently in the last day almost everyone has been told that the for-profit structure is not happening and he is happy about this at least since he just wants the team to be heads down again.

Heads up, spoke to some of the safety team and there were a lot of concerns about the ICO and possible unintended effects in the future.

Planning to talk to the whole team tomorrow and invite input. Going to emphasize the need to keep this confidential, but I think it's really important we get buy-in and give people the chance to weigh in early.

The ICLR conference (which is the top deep learning - specific conference (NIPS is larger, but more diffuse)) released their decisions for accepted/rejected papers, and someone made some nice plots that show where the current deep learning / AI research happens at. It's an imperfect measure because not every company might prioritize paper publications, but it's indicative.

Here's a plot that shows the total number of papers (broken down by oral/poster/workshop/rejected) from any institution:

Long story short, Google is dominating with 83 paper submissions. The academic institutions (Berkeley / Stanford / CMU / MIT) are next, in 20-30 ranges each.

OpenAI is on a path of certain failure relative to Google. There obviously needs to be immediate and dramatic action or everyone except for Google will be consigned to irrelevance.

I have considered the ICO approach and will not support it. In my opinion, that would simply result in a massive loss of credibility for OpenAI and everyone associated with the ICO. If something seems too good to be true, it is. This was, in my opinion, an unwise diversion.

The only paths I can think of are a major expansion of OpenAI and a major expansion of Tesla AI. Perhaps both simultaneously. The former would require a major increase in funds donated and highly credible people joining our board. The current board situation is very weak.

I will set up a time for us to talk tomorrow. To be clear, I have a lot of respect for your abilities and accomplishments, but I am not happy with how things have been managed. That is why I have had trouble engaging with OpenAI in recent months. Either we fix things and my engagement increases a lot or we don’t and I will drop to near zero and publicly reduce my association. I will not be in a situation where the perception of my influence and time doesn’t match the reality.

### _**Elon Musk** to Andrej Karpathy - Jan 31, 2018 2:07 PM_

fyi

What do you think makes sense? Happy to talk by phone if that’s better.

### _**Andrej Karpathy** to Elon Musk - Jan 31, 2018 11:54 PM_

Working at the cutting edge of AI is unfortunately expensive. For example, DeepMind's operating expenses in 2016 were at around $250M USD (does not include compute). With their growing team today it might be ~0.5B/yr. But then Alphabet in 2016 reported ~20B net income so it's still fairly cheap even if DeepMind had no revenue of its own. In addition to DeepMind, Google also has Google Brain, Research, and Cloud. And TensorFlow, TPUs, and they own about a third of all research (in fact, they hold their own AI conferences).

I also strongly suspect that compute horsepower will be necessary (and possibly even sufficient) to reach AGI. If historical trends are any indication, progress in AI is primarily driven by systems - compute, data, infrastructure. The core algorithms we use today have remained largely unchanged from the ~90s. Not only that, but any algorithmic advances published in a paper somewhere can be almost immediately re-implemented and incorporated. Conversely, algorithmic advances alone are inert without the scale to also make them scary.

It seems to me that OpenAI today is burning cash and that the funding model cannot reach the scale to seriously compete with Google (an 800B company). If you can't seriously compete but continue to do research in open, you might in fact be making things worse and helping them out "for free", because any advances are fairly easy for them to copy and immediately incorporate, at scale.

A for-profit pivot might create a more sustainable revenue stream over time and would, with the current team, likely bring in a lot of investment. However, building out a product from scratch would steal focus from AI research, it would take a long time and it's unclear if a company could "catch up" to Google scale, and the investors might exert too much pressure in the wrong directions.

The most promising option I can think of, as I mentioned earlier, would be for OpenAI to attach to Tesla as its cash cow. I believe attachments to other large suspects (e.g. Apple? Amazon?) would fail due to an incompatible company DNA. Using a rocket analogy, Tesla already built the "first stage" of the rocket with the whole supply chain of Model 3 and its onboard computer and a persistent internet connection. The "second stage" would be a full self driving solution based on large-scale neural network training, which OpenAI expertise could significantly help accelerate. With a functioning full self-driving solution in ~2-3 years we could sell a lot of cars/trucks. If we do this really well, the transportation industry is large enough that we could increase Tesla's market cap to high O(~100K), and use that revenue to fund the AI work at the appropriate scale.

I cannot see anything else that has the potential to reach sustainable Google-scale capital within a decade.

_\[Forwarded previous message from Andrej\]_

Andrej is exactly right. We may wish it otherwise, but, in my and Andrej’s opinion, Tesla is the only path that could even hope to hold a candle to Google. Even then, the probability of being a counterweight to Google is small. It just isn’t zero.

**OpenAI**

Fundraising:

\-No longer doing the ICO / “instrument to purchase compute in advance” type structure. Altman is thinking through an instrument where the 4-5 large corporates who are interested can invest with a return capped at 50x if OpenAI does get to some semblance of money-making AGI. They apparently seem willing just for access reasons. He wants to discuss with you in more detail.

Formal Board Resignation:

\-You're still technically on the board so need to send a quick one liner to Sam Altman saying something like “With this email I hereby resign as a director of OpenAI, effective Feb 20th 2018”.

Future Board:

\-Altman said he is cool with me joining then having to step off if I become conflicted, but is concerned that others would consider it a burned bridge if I had to step off. I think best bet is not to join for now and be an ambiguous advisor but let me know if you feel differently. They have Adam D’Angelo as the potential fifth to take your place, which seems great?

**TeslaAI**

Andrej has three candidates in pipeline, may have 1-2 come in to meet you on Tuesday. He will send you a briefing note about them. Also, he’s working on starter language for a potential release that will be ready to discuss Tuesday. It will follow the “full-stack AI lab” angle we talked about but, if that doesn’t feel right, please course correct... is tricky messaging.

**Cerebras**

Chip should be available in August for them to test, and they plan to let others have remote access in September. The Cerebras guy also mentioned that a lot of their recent customer interest has been from companies upset about the Nvidia change in terms of service (the one that forces companies away from consumer grade GPUs to enterprise Pascals / Voltas). Scott Gray and Ilya continue to spend a bunch of time with them

**Subject:** The OpenAI Charter
-------------------------------

### _**Sam Altman** to Elon Musk, (cc: Shivon Zilis) - Apr 2, 2018 1:54 PM_

_We are planning to release this next week--any thoughts?_

The OpenAI Charter

OpenAI's mission is to ensure that artificial general intelligence (AGI) — by which we mean highly autonomous systems that outperform humans at most economically-valuable creative work — benefits all of humanity. We will attempt to directly build safe and beneficial AGI, but will also consider our mission fulfilled if our work aids others to achieve this outcome. To that end, we commit to the following principles:

**Broadly Distributed Benefits**

> We commit to use any influence we obtain over AGI’s deployment to ensure it is used for the benefit of all, and to avoid enabling uses of AI or AGI that harm humanity or unduly concentrate power.

> Our primary fiduciary duty is to humanity. We anticipate needing to marshal substantial resources to fulfill our mission, but will always assiduously act to minimize conflicts of interest among our employees and stakeholders that could compromise broad benefit.

**Long-Term Safety**

> We are committed to doing the research required to make AGI safe, and to driving the broad adoption of such research across the AI community.

> We are concerned about late-stage AGI development becoming a competitive race without time for adequate safety precautions. Therefore, if a value-aligned, safety-conscious project comes close to building AGI before we do, we commit to stop competing with and start assisting this project. We will work out specifics in case by case agreements, but a typical triggering condition might be "a better-than-even chance of success in the next 2 years".

**Technical Leadership**

> To be effective at addressing AGI's impact on society, OpenAI must be on the cutting edge of AI capabilities — policy and safety advocacy alone would be insufficient.

> We believe that AI will have broad societal impact before AGI, and we’ll strive to lead in those areas that are directly aligned with our mission and expertise.

**Cooperative Orientation**

> We will actively cooperate with other research and policy institutions; we seek to create a global community working together to address AGI’s global challenges.

> We are committed to providing public goods that help society navigate the path to AGI. Today this includes publishing most of our AI research, but we expect that safety and security concerns will reduce our traditional publishing in the future, while increasing the importance of sharing safety, policy, and standards research.

### _**Shivon Zilis** to Elon Musk, (cc: Sam Teller) - Apr 23, 2018 1:49 AM (continued from thread with same subject above)_

Updated info per a conversation with Altman. You’re tentatively set to speak with him on Tuesday.

Financing:

\-He confirmed again that they are definitely not doing an ICO but rather equity that has a fixed maximum return.

\-Would be a rather unique subsidiary structure for the raise which he wants to walk you through.

\-Wants to move within 4-6 week on first round (probably largely Reid money, potentially some corporates).

**Tech:**

Says Dota 5v5 looking better than anticipated.

\-The sharp rise in Dota bot performance is apparently causing people internally to worry that the timeline to AGI is sooner than they’d thought before.

\-Thinks they are on track to beat Montezuma’s Revenge shortly.

**Time allocation:**

\-I’ve reallocated most of the hours I used to spend with OpenAI to Neuralink and Tesla. This naturally happened with you stepping off the board and related factors — but if you’d prefer I pull more hours back to OpenAI oversight please let me know.

\-Sam and Greg asked if I’d be on their informal advisory board (just Gabe Newell so far), which seems fine and better than the formal board given potential conflicts? If that doesn’t feel right let me know what you’d prefer.

### _**Sam Altman** to Elon Musk, (cc: Sam Teller, Shivon Zilis) - Mar 6, 2019 3:13PM_

Elon—

Here is a draft post we are planning for Monday. Anything to add/edit?

**TL;DR:**

*   We've created the capped-profit company and raised the first round, led by Reid and Vinod.
*   We did this is a way where all investors are clear that they should never expect a profit.
*   We made Greg chairman and me CEO of the new entity.
*   We have tested this structure with potential next-round investors and they seem to like it.

Speaking of the last point, we are now discussing a multi-billion dollar investment which I would like to get your advice on when you have time. Happy to come see you some time you are in the bay area.

Sam

Draft post[\[3\]](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/5jjk4CDnj9tA7ugxr/openai-email-archives-from-musk-v-altman#fngg8mwv4o956)

We've created OpenAI LP, a new "capped-profit" company that allows us to rapidly increase our investments in compute and talent while including checks and balances to actualize our mission.

Our mission is to ensure that artificial general intelligence (AGI) benefits all of humanity, primarily by attempting to build safe AGI and share the benefits with the world.

Due to the exponential growth of compute investments in the field, we’ve needed to scale much faster than we’d planned when starting OpenAI. We expect to need to raise many billions of dollars in upcoming years for large-scale cloud compute, attracting and retaining talented people, and building AI supercomputers.

We haven’t been able to raise that much money as a nonprofit, and though we considered becoming a for-profit, we were afraid that doing so would mean giving up our mission.

Instead, we created a new company, OpenAI LP, as a hybrid for-profit and nonprofit — which we are calling a "capped-profit" company.

The fundamental idea of OpenAI LP is that investors and employees can get a fixed return if we succeed at our mission, which allows us to raise investment capital and attract employees with startup-like equity. But any returns beyond that amount — and if we are successful, we expect to generate orders of magnitude more value than we’d owe to people who invest in or work at OpenAI LP — are owned by the original OpenAI Nonprofit entity.

Going forward (in this post and elsewhere), “OpenAI” refers to OpenAI LP (which now employs most of our staff), and the original entity is referred to as “OpenAI Nonprofit”.

**The mission comes first**

We’ve designed OpenAI LP to put our overall mission — ensuring the creation and adoption of safe and beneficial AGI — over generating returns for investors.

To minimize conflicts of interest with the mission, OpenAI LP’s primary fiduciary obligation is to advance the aims of the OpenAI Charter, and the company is controlled by OpenAI Nonprofit’s board. All investors and employees sign agreements that OpenAI LP’s obligation to the Charter always comes first, even at the expense of some or all of their financial stake.

_Our employee and investor paperwork starts like this. The general partner refers to OpenAI Nonprofit (whose official name is “OpenAI Inc”); limited partners refers to investors and employees._

_Only a minority of board members can hold financial stakes in the partnership. Furthermore, only board members without such stakes are allowed to vote on decisions where the interests of limited partners and the nonprofit’s mission may conflict — including any decisions about making payouts to investors and employees._

**Corporate structure**

Another provision from our paperwork specifies that the nonprofit retains control. (The paperwork uses OpenAI LP’s official name “OpenAI, L.P.”.)

As mentioned above, economic returns for investors and employees are capped (with the cap negotiated in advance on a per-limited partner basis). Any excess returns are owned by the nonprofit. Our goal is to ensure that most of the value we create if successful is returned to the world, so we think this is an important first step. Returns for our first round of investors are capped to 100x their investment, and we expect this multiple to be lower for future rounds.

**What OpenAI does**

Our day-to-day work remains the same. Today, we believe we can build the most value by focusing exclusively on developing new AI technologies, not commercial products. Our structure gives us flexibility for how to make money in the long term, but we hope to figure that out only once we’ve created safe AGI (though we’re open to non-distracting revenue sources such as licensing in the interim).

OpenAI LP currently employs around 100 people organized into three main areas: capabilities (advancing what AI systems can do), safety (ensuring those systems are aligned with human values), and policy (ensuring appropriate governance for such systems). OpenAI Nonprofit governs OpenAI LP, runs educational programs such as Scholars and Fellows, and hosts policy initiatives. OpenAI LP is continuing (at increased pace and scale) the development roadmap started at OpenAI Nonprofit, which has yielded breakthroughs in reinforcement learning, robotics, and language.

**Safety**

We are concerned about AGI’s potential to cause rapid change, whether through machines pursuing goals misspecified by their operator, malicious humans subverting deployed systems, or an out-of-control economy that grows without resulting in improvements to human lives. As described in our Charter, we are willing to merge with a value-aligned organization (even if it means reduced or zero payouts to investors) to avoid a competitive race which would make it hard to prioritize safety.

**Who’s involved**

OpenAI Nonprofit’s board consists of OpenAI LP employees Greg Brockman (Chairman & CTO), Ilya Sutskever (Chief Scientist), and Sam Altman (CEO), and non-employees Adam D’Angelo, Holden Karnofsky, Reid Hoffman, Sue Yoon, and Tasha McCauley.

Elon Musk left the board of OpenAI Nonprofit in February 2018 and is not involved with OpenAI LP.

Our investors include Reid Hoffman and Khosla Ventures.

We are traveling a hard and uncertain path, but we have designed our structure to help us positively affect the world should we succeed in creating AGI. If you’d like to help us make this mission a reality, we’re hiring :)!
