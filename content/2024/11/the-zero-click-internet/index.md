## Summary
**摘要**：
未来变动如滔天巨浪，互联网正在经历自其创造以来的最大变革。这种变化就是 zeroes 网络，它将改变你做所有事情的方式。Zeroes 网络意味着你不需要点击链接来寻找想要的内容。实际上，网络的很大一部分内容就是这样工作的。

**要点总结**：

1. **网络演化趋势**：随着社交平台如 Facebook 和 Twitter 放弃链接推广，将内容直接在平台上发布而非引导使用者访问外站，给网络带来更多直接展示的趋势。加之生成式 AI 的加入，平台更倾向于直接展示内容，不论内容来源于数据库还是由 AI 创造。

2. **搜索结果变化**：从 Google 开始，直接在搜索结果页面上的回答表明了对简单的查询的直接响应。AI 聊天机器人和推荐算法的提升使得此现象升级。重大变革体现在 Google 现在踊跃地抓取内容并直接展示在搜索结果中，使仅存的搜索结果深藏于页面底端，几乎无人点击。

3. **领域的更迭与消失**：此变革是由 Google 的内容展示包影响终结许多数字发布业务开始，从小到大部分，在今年结束；中等规模的则可能在春季消失。主要的发布业务将逐渐与 Google 或 OpenAI 等平台签订合同以创造特定的内容供它们抓取。域名不再具有价值，因为访问网站不再是互联网交通的主要部分。大多数域名注册商，如 GoDaddy 等依靠出售域名的业务将面临结束。

4. **商业生态的终结**：包括网络广告业在内的大规模商业生态系统都将终结。广告将被主要平台（如 Google、Meta、亚马逊等）全面控制，这些大平台已经占据超过 60% 的在线广告支出。网络广告销售平台，如 Raptive 和 Playwire 将失去网站售出广告的机会，最终走向毁灭。

5. **SEO 的末日**：SEO（搜索引擎优化）将不再有效，当点击次数完全消失时。尽管 SEO 公司可以通过聚焦于本地或小众 SEO 生存下来，但即使是这些领域最终也会被 Zeroes 网络所吞噬。该环境基于平台级别的可见性决定，SEO 完全无关紧要。

这些行业的多亿美元规模生意在 2026 年将以显着的业务面貌结束。在这变革的未来，使用者的信息将完全流失，只能找到已被付费许可查找的信息。Zeroes 网络只会限制使用者获取以往在一套好的百科全书上能找到的表面级信息。而那些深度资源将不再存在，或者只是残留于不可靠的大规模语言模型的记忆中。这是未来的景象，在这种不可避免、全面影响的新型 Zeroes 网络生态系统之中。

这专栏便是 Zeroes 网络的产物。在 X 上作为一系列贴文发布。一年前，我会将它发布在我的网站上，但现在，没有人会去查看。关于WordPress所面临的问题争论似乎有些不合时宜。在 Zeroes 网络的范畴内，WordPress 已经无关紧要。挑战的冰山一角，Zeroes 网络对商业生态的深远影响正在显露。如果你运营着web设计业务，你可能需要准备去关闭公司。作为平面设计师，你或许只能立足于谷歌，否则前途茫茫。

这标志着传统的终结和新形式的转变。从长远来看，是好是坏尚未能定论，但在短期内，我们将目睹前所未有的动荡，而这正是少数体制未准备应对的情形。

The internet is in the midst of undergoing the biggest change since its inception. It's huge. And there is no going back.

The web is changing into the _Zero Click Internet_, and it will change everything about how you do everything. Zero Click Internet means you'll no longer click on links to find the content you want. In fact, much of the internet already works this way.

**Editor's Note:**  
Guest author Josh Tyler is an entrepreneur and early internet pioneer, best known as the founder of CinemaBlend and [Giant Freakin Robot](https://www.giantfreakinrobot.com/). He currently serves as the CEO of [Walk Big Media](https://walkbig.com/). This opinion column was originally [posted on X](https://x.com/joshtyler/status/1845715487126405414).

Platforms like Facebook and Twitter stopped promoting posts with links a few years ago. This forced users on those platforms to post content directly there instead of directing followers to external sites. And now with generative AI in the mix, platforms are even more incentivized to surface content directly, whether it's pulled from their databases or created by AI.

This phenomenon isn't entirely new; it began when Google started answering simple queries directly on its search results page. But it's escalated significantly with the rise of AI chatbots and advanced recommendation algorithms.

Google is now aggressively scraping content from websites and displaying it directly in search results. What few search results remain are buried so far down the page that almost no one sees or clicks on them anymore. And Google's plan is to bury them even further in coming months. And that's what a Zero Click Internet means. It means an end to users visiting websites, entirely.

Instead you'll spend all your time on a small handful of platforms and apps like Google or TikTok and never leave them. The impact this will have, not just on your experience but on the world, will be massive.

What a Zero Click Internet means is an end to users visiting websites, entirely.

It means an end to digital publishers. The small ones at first. Most of those will be out of business by the end of this year. Then the medium ones will vanish, most likely they will all be gone by spring. Eventually, most of the big publishers will go under. Those that survive will do so by signing contracts with platforms like Google or OpenAI (ChatGPT) to create content specifically for them to scrape.

Domain names will no longer have any value, since visiting websites will no longer be a significant portion of most internet traffic. This will spell the end for most domain registrars like GoDaddy and other companies whose entire business revolves around selling domains.

The web hosting business will contract as the number of websites in existence shrinks and the number of resources needed to run the remaining ones will decrease. Most smaller hosting companies will likely be out of business by the end of 2025.

The independent internet advertising business is also done for. All advertising will be controlled by the major platforms (Google, Meta/Facebook, Amazon, and company already account for over 60% of all online ad spend).

Case in point, Google and TikTok don't buy ads from independent networks like Raptive or Playwire (which sell ads on medium-sized websites) because they do it themselves. As publishers vanish, these networks will have no websites to sell ads on, meaning they'll likely be out of business by the end of 2025 as well.

The SEO industry is also doomed. SEO becomes meaningless when there are no clicks. Currently, SEO firms can survive the death of the digital publishing industry by focusing on local or niche SEO, but even those areas will eventually be absorbed into the Zero Click environment.

And that environment is largely driven by who will pay top dollar to be at the top of a platform's results (Facebook, Google, TikTok, Instagram, LinkedIn, etc.), and who is willing to do all their business on that platform. Visibility will be determined by contracts, rendering SEO irrelevant.

Each of these industries I've mentioned are multi-billion dollar industries, and none of them will exist as a significant business by the end of 2026. As for users, information will totally vanish. You'll only be able to find information someone has paid to allow you to find.

The Zero Click Internet will limit you to the kind of surface-level information you'd once find in a good set of encyclopedias. And the deeper resources you might have once turned to will no longer exist – except perhaps as fragmented remnants in the mind of an unreliable Large Language Model.

And that's what the future looks like, in the now totally inevitable, all encompassing ecosphere of the new Zero Click Internet.

This very column is a product of the Zero Click Internet (it was [originally published](https://x.com/joshtyler/status/1845715487126405414) as a thread on X). A year ago, I would have posted it as an article on my website. But if I had done that now, no one would have seen it. That's why the fuss over what's [happening with WordPress](https://www.techspot.com/news/105094-does-ongoing-fued-between-automattic-wp-engine-threaten.html) seems a bit ridiculous. WordPress has no future in a Zero Click Internet. It's irrelevant.

And this is just scratching the surface of the impact a Zero Click Internet will have. Own a web design business? Prepare to go out of business. Are you a graphic designer? Hopefully, you work for Google, because otherwise, your future is bleak.

It's the end of how things are, and a shift into something else. Whether it's good or bad in the long run remains to be seen, but in the short term, we're going to witness upheaval on a scale few are prepared to handle.
