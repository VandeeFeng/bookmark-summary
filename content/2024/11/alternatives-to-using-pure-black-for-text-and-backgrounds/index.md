## Summary
**摘要**：
《纯黑(#000000)用作文本和背景的替代方案》是一篇文章，作者Dmitry Sergushkin探讨关于设计中使用完全黑色的困难和替代方式。文章强调，虽然黑色与白色对比度高，易于阅读，但它们对用户的视觉刺激过于强烈，可能导致眼疲劳，从而影响用户体验。文章提出更换色彩方案以提高设计的舒适性和用户便利性。

**要点总结**：
1. **纯黑颜色的利弊分析**：文章讨论了使用纯黑作为背景和文本的一种传统选择方式，这种做法提供高可读性，因为黑色与白色之间存在明显对比。然而，长时间工作在强对比环境中，人眼会感到不适和疲劳。

2. **用户为中心设计（UCD）的视角**：作者强调在设计时要考虑颜色选择对用户的影响，特别是对视力有障碍的人。良好的设计为用户带来舒适、直观的体验，减少干扰，而糟糕的设计则引起不适，降低用户体验或导致用户放弃产品的可能性。

3. **过渡到无纯黑的色彩方案**：作者提议在设计中探索转换为使用中间色调（灰色、棕色、深蓝色等），以减少高对比度给眼睛带来的影响，同时保持所需的清晰性。这有助于缓解眼睛疲劳，并能在不同类型的设备上提供更好的可读性和一致性。

4. **色彩视觉因素**：文章还讨论了色彩理论，提到了例如饱和度、亮度和色相变化，这些因素对用户心理感受的影响，以及如何利用这些视觉元素创作出既美观又舒适的界面设计。

5. **结论与实践建议**：综上所述，文章最终建议设计师在选择用色时应结合技术标准，包括色域和屏幕对比度，以及不同文化和人群的视觉偏好，构建具有高适应性和舒适性的界面，使设计既美观又实用。

In order to achieve maximum contrast in design, interface designers often use a combination of pure black and white colors, which helps create visual depth with clear boundaries and effectively highlight key elements such as text, buttons or icons. Pure Black **(**[**#000000**](https://www.color-hex.com/color/000000)**)** has 0% color brightness, while white is 100% bright **(**[**#FFFFFF**](https://www.color-hex.com/color/ffffff)**)** is 100%. The significant difference in color brightness causes discomfort and strain on the user’s eyes and leads to rapid eye fatigue when viewing content on the device for extended periods. On the one hand, the contrast of black and white colors gives maximum clarity for the human eye improving visual acuity, but on the other hand, prolonged exposure forces the retina to constantly adapt to the sharp difference in brightness, begins to experience strain. Therefore, when designing solutions, it's important to ask yourself the question future design is oriented on aesthetics or on the convenience of users. In [User-Centered Design (UCD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User-centered_design), it’s important to consider how the colors chosen affect users, especially those who may have vision problems.

> **“Good design, when it’s done well, becomes invisible. It’s only when it’s done poorly that we notice it.”** [Jared M. Spool](https://medium.com/u/b90ef6212176?source=post_page---user_mention--54ef0e733cdb--------------------------------)

When the design is "Good", users don’t notice it — the interface becomes comfortable and intuitive, allowing them to perform tasks without distraction. But if the design causes discomfort, for example because of sharp contrast, unreadability, it becomes noticeable and distracting, and it’s more likely that the user will have a negative experience from using your product, or will stop interacting with it altogether.

**Why you should never use pure black for text or backgrounds**
===============================================================

Although black text on a white background is a traditional and popular solution that provides readability due to high contrast, it has its drawbacks, such as eye strain caused by prolonged interaction with the text, especially for people with sensitivity to bright light or contrast. Here are some reasons why it’s bad for users:

**1\. Eye Strain when scanning text content on digital devices  
**It's important to consider the difference between printed materials and device screens. When reading black text on white paper in books and magazines, we see an improvement in readability, but in the case of digital devices, users interact with the brightness of the screens that display the text for long periods of time, which affects the retina of the eye, which in turn causes general fatigue. This happens because the eyes have to constantly adapt to the bright background, which causes an unnatural and uncomfortable feeling of “glare”. Also when scanning light objects on a dark background, which requires more effort and strain, especially when reading for long periods of time.

**2\. Halo effect when reading white text on a black background  
**Pure white text on a black background should be used sparingly in design. In users with astigmatism it can cause a distracting halo effect around the text. A halo effect is when a blur of light surrounds the brightness amid the darkness. This may affect people with myopia (nearsightedness), astigmatism (an irregularity in the curvature at the front of the eye), or presbyopia (an age-related decline in ability to focus on things that are near the eyes).

> According to [Statistics](https://www.eye-deology.com/fyeyes/5-interesting-statistics-about-astigmatism), approximately **50% of the population suffers from some form of astigmatism**. According to the American Optometric Association, about one-third of the U.S. population has some degree of astigmatism. This means that millions of Americans experience the blurred or distorted vision associated with this condition.  
> A study published in the journal Ophthalmology found that **more than 70% of children aged 5 to 17 have astigmatism**. The Contact Lens Council reports that **almost 45% of all contact lens wearers in the United States have astigmatism**.

Accessibility
=============

When choosing colors for a design, it’s crucial to take into account the needs of users depending on their visual abilities, it's necessary to find a balance between the benefits of high contrast for users with low vision and the negative impact of high contrast for users with normal vision. For visually impaired users who have residual vision but not total blindness, high contrast between text and background is critical, in which case black text on a white background or white text on a black background provides the necessary contrast and clarity. While for users with normal vision, excessive sharpness causes tension and discomfort.  
So where is the middle ground or compromise in this matter? One solution that can help solve this dilemma is to include a high contrast mode in the product with the ability to enable it in the accessibility settings for visually impaired users. We can find examples of this in iOS (“Smart Invert” and “Dark Mode”), macOS (“Invert Colors” and “Increase Contrast” Mode), Google Chrome (“High Contrast” Extension), YouTube (High Contrast Subtitles).

Pure black text on white background
===================================

The use of black text on a white background has been popular long before the advent of computers and digital devices. In the 18th and 19th centuries, books, newspapers and magazines and other printed matter used a black and white color palette because it was readable and accessible. As we moved into the digital age, this pattern continued on computer screens and other devices, and black text continues to be read by users on platforms and online resources. An alternative approach is to use softer, moderately saturated dark gray, dark blue, and other dark shades, provided that readability and sufficient contrast are maintained, which will reduce strain on the user’s eyes and create natural and comfortable conditions for scanning content, while maintaining a touch of sophistication.

Example of using alternate colors for text instead of pure black

White text on a black background
================================

A classic example of a dark background and light text is dark mode. Recently, dark interface mode has become increasingly popular, and many companies and platforms are incorporating this feature for their users. In report [**_“Dark Mode Usage Statistics: Users Optimize Battery, Reduce Eye Strain” Alexander Eser_**](https://worldmetrics.org/dark-mode-usage-statistics/) provides some interesting statistics about dark mode for 2024 year:

*   82% of smartphone users prefer dark mode.
*   Dark mode reduces eye strain for 93% of users.
*   89% of users find dark mode easier on the eyes in low-light conditions.
*   55% of desktop users prefer using dark mode.
*   67% of macOS users are using dark mode.
*   75% of Android users enable dark mode on their devices.
*   61% of iPhone users prefer using dark mode.
*   Dark mode is favored by 78% of email users.
*   83% of Twitch users use dark mode.
*   Dark mode can help reduce symptoms of digital eye strain by 35%.

An alternative solution may be to use light text in varying shades within acceptable contrast levels, creating a visual hierarchy that allows users to easily distinguish important design elements from less important ones. Thus, the user will visually scan text content in soft light colors without experiencing discomfort and will focus on important information.

Example of using alternate colors for text instead of white

Alternative colors for pure black in design
===========================================

Based on my personal research and consultations with fellow designers, I have developed a color palette of alternative shades that can be used in design instead of pure black (#000000). These colors provide a less saturated appearance to text content, using charcoal grays and other dark tones to maintain essential readability while reducing contrast against a light background and reducing eye strain when interacting with content for long periods of time. The purpose of this research was to find the most effective shades for modern interface design.

Color pallet for use in place of Pure Black (#000000)

For your convenience, I have listed all the colors from the palette with their codes below. Just copy and apply the code you want instead of pure black:

1\. Charcoal Gray **|** **Hex #121212**2\. Dark Slate Gray | **Hex: #191919**3\. Outer Space | **Hex: #252525**4\. Rich Black | **Hex: #0A0A0A**5\. Coffee Bean | **Hex: #1B1B1B**6\. Dark Gray | **Hex: #212427**7\. Oil Black | **Hex: #0C0C0C**8\. Obsidian | **Hex: #0B1215**  
9\. Ebony | **Hex: #222428**10\. Black Chocolate | **Hex: #100D08**11\. Gunmetal | **Hex: #1D1F21**12\. Smoky Black | **Hex: #101720**13\. Oxford Blue | **Hex: #212A37**14\. Eerie Black | **Hex: #232023**15\. Jet Black | **Hex: #161618**16\. Iridium | **Hex: #181818**17\. Arsenic | **Hex: #11181C**18\. Charleston Green | **Hex: #212124**19\. Dark Gunmetal | **Hex: #222428**20\. Jet | **Hex: #2A2A2A**21\. Black Olive | **Hex: #242526**22\. Midnight Blue | **Hex: #212121**

The Take Away
=============

When designing solutions for digital products, we as designers must take into account the needs of users, create interfaces that will be comfortable for users with normal vision and take into account accessibility for users with visual impairments. Create “Good designs” without distracting users from interacting, making the user experience seamless and enjoyable, even over long interactions. Using pure black text on a light background or white text on a black background is not right or wrong, but given the current trends in user needs, taking care of them is important to look for alternative solutions that will accommodate and improve the experience.
