## Summary
**摘要**：
这篇名为《美国的超级力量》的博文中，作者Ted Lamade，Carnegie Institute的合伙人，指出美国总统选举的细微差距是美国的一大超级力量——“选择性”。这种选择性指的是美国公民有能力，但没有义务，每四年改变国家的方向。这种双党制系统使得国家得以运行，并依据市民意见和意愿做出政策调整。文章用阿根廷和中国的例子来说明没有选择性可能导致国家走向衰落，而美国的选择性确保了市场、经济和金融的健康发展，使其成为世界上最活跃的国家和经济体之一。

**要点总结**：
1. **选择性**：美国人每四年可以改变国家的方向。国家有能力选择改变政策，但如果认为白宫的政策偏离，可以投票改变方向。
2. **美国的优势**：美国拥有地理、资源（能源、农田、可通航的水道）、多元人口、受教育的劳动力和企业家精神，以及世界上最强的军事、经济和金融市场。
3. **边缘化的意义**：美国总统选举的细微差距体现了选择性，它使美国成为世界强国的助推器，确保了系统的动态性和创新性。
4. **对比阿根廷和中国**：阿根廷曾因缺乏选择性，遭受经济不稳定、经济增长低迷、债务违约和高通胀。同样，中国的“一党治国”导致失去选择性，将国家引向类似路径，从而潜在地加剧腐败，经济失衡，并恶化与西方的关系。
5. **民主力量与生长机会**：最活跃的民主国家，如澳大利亚、丹麦、芬兰、荷兰、新西兰、挪威、瑞典、瑞士和英国，拥有最平衡、最具弹性的经济，最低廉的腐败，并与美国保持最牢固的盟国关系，它们的股票市场也相应表现强劲。

文章强调了选择性在塑造国家未来中的至关重要的力量，并对比了缺乏选择性的国家走向衰败的情况。文章提出了选择性与民主、经济增长和稳定的正面关联，并暗示了返回适当选择性的潜力，以逆转像中国这样的国家当前面临的经济和社会问题。

America’s Superpower

Guest post by Ted Lamade, Managing Director at The Carnegie Institution for Science

**_“Our political leaders will know our priorities only if we tell them, again and again, and if those priorities begin to show up in the polls.”_**

**_— Peggy Noonan_**

Ahead of Thanksgiving, I thought it would be timely to write about something every American should be thankful for, so here it goes.

The United States just concluded its 60th presidential election and every American should be thankful.

Now, before everyone who voted for Kamala Harris starts to fume, hear me out.

The reality is that every American should be thankful after every election, _regardless of the outcome._

You heard that right.

_Every_ American should be thankful after every election. In fact, every American should also be thankful that these elections are often determined by razor thin margins.

Why?

Because these elections highlight one of America’s greatest superpowers – its “optionality”.

Let me explain.

Optionality is defined as, _“The ability_, but not the obligation, to choose a specific path.”

America’s optionality stems from the fact that its citizens have the ability, but not the obligation, to change the country’s direction every four years. If things are going well, Americans can choose to “stay the course”. However, if they believe the party occupying the White House has swung too far in one direction, they can vote to move the country in a different one.

Don’t get me wrong. America has a lot else going for it, including being protected by two massive oceans on its coasts and two friendly nations to its north and south, vast resources (energy, farmland, and navigable waterways), a diverse population, an educated workforce and entrepreneurial ethos, and the world’s strongest military, economy, and financial markets. However, Americans’ ability to choose how to leverage these assets most effectively is what makes it the most dynamic country and economy in the world.

As to why Americans should be thankful that their elections are determined by razor thin margins, the fact is that if America had one dominant political party (i.e. “one party rule”), it would be much more difficult to enact change. Thankfully though, American swing voters play an instrumental part in how the country is run, as evidenced by the most recent election.

![Image 4: Screenshot 2024-11-26 at 1.36.21 PM.png](https://collabfund.com/uploads/Screenshot%202024-11-26%20at%201.36.21%E2%80%AFPM.png)

Now, a logical response would be,

“But don’t these razor-thin margins lead to elevated tension, friction, and division, especially in the lead up to and after elections?”

Of course, but that is because optionality isn’t free. In fact, it _always_ comes with a cost. Yet, the tension and division associated with optionality is almost always cheaper than the alternative.

Look no further than Argentina.

A century ago, Argentina was one of the strongest and wealthiest countries in the world. With endless resources, a diverse and literate population, and a diversified industrial base, Argentina was positioned for an incredibly bright future. European nations had started investing heavily, while countless multinational companies were opening offices or plants throughout the country (including manufacturing, retail, advertising, construction, and finance companies, as well as law firms). Some even declared its capital, Buenos Aires, “The Next Paris”.

Then, everything began to change.

In 1913 Argentina suffered a coup d’état, which was followed by a series of government overthrows that resulted in alternating periods of democracy and military rule. Then, with the rise of Peronism in the mid-1940’s, the country embarked in what amounted to more than 75 years of “one-party rule”.

The result?

Argentina went from being one of the world’s wealthiest countries in the world as measured on a GDP-per-capita basis to one ravaged by inflation (regularly north of 20% and over 100% in 2023), corruption, poverty (currently over 40%), and a rolling series of debt defaults.

So, how did this happen?

It happened because Argentinians lost their optionality. They lost their ability to institute change. To shape their destiny. As a result, a country many thought would be one of the next great global powers instead suffered a historic decline.

Sound familiar to something we are witnessing today?

It should, because after Xi Jinping removed term limits and instilled himself as “president for life” in 2018, the Chinese people were stripped of their optionality (while the Chinese do not have democratic elections, its leaders in the years prior to Xi typically responded to the needs/wants of the Chinese people and were chosen by consensus every ten years).

In doing so, Xi appears to have put China on a path similar to Argentina, or for that matter Russia, Turkey, Iran, and many Middle Eastern countries that are currently one-party or autocratic states. Unsurprisingly, these are the countries saddled with corruption, unbalanced economies, and on poor terms with the “West”.

Meanwhile nations with the most vibrant democracies, and therefore optionality (e.g., countries like Australia, Denmark, Finland, The Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and the UK) are also the least corrupt, have the most balanced and resilient economies, and are some of the United States’ strongest allies. Unsurprisingly, these nations have also historically had some of the strongest equity markets.

Funny how that works.

The fact is, optionality is one of the most underappreciated things in life. It is what enables you to be nimble, change course, adjust on the fly, and self-correct. It is also what allows you to get through difficult moments, while simultaneously participating in the good ones.

While Americans may fight over the country’s path forward, be vicious with one another at times, and either get upset when their candidate loses or thrilled when they win, we should cherish our elections because it means we have the ability (but not the obligation) to change the path we are on. To choose our destiny.

As it relates to China, so long as optionality is absent, consumer confidence will remain depressed (has fallen more than 30% since Xi removed term limits), net capital outflows will continue, economic conditions will likely deteriorate further, and its equity markets will languish.

Frankly, this is what makes the country feel un-investable to me right now.

That said, if China reverts to a system of term limits, things could change quickly and dramatically.

After all, this is precisely what has happened in Argentina after its citizens elected libertarian Javier Milei last year. The results so far have been astounding as Argentina has experienced a [material drop in inflation, green shoots in economic growth, and world leading equity returns as a result of his sweeping changes](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/453-javier-milei-president-of-argentina-freedom/id1434243584?i=1000677651141).

Often times the things we should be most thankful for aren’t obvious because they come with a cost. In the case of our elections, the cost is more than well worth it.
