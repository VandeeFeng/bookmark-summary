  original_title: Writes and Write-Nots - 写作能力的分化
---
## Summary
**摘要**：
文章分析了写作在现代技术中的角色转变，预见了一个写作能力和不被需要的二元世界。技术发展降低了人们写作的难度，带来了AI写作工具的便利，使得越来越多的任务可以由AI代替人类完成，从而减少对写作技巧的依赖。文章指出，在这一转变中形成的是“写作者”和“不写作者”两种角色的分类。写作者是那些擅长或愿意进行写作的人，而“不写作者”指的是在不依赖技术情况下无法或不愿意完成写作任务的人。作者还提到，写作不仅是语言能力的体现，更是思考的过程，因此写作能力的缺失会带来思考能力的欠缺，最终可能导致一个“思考者”与“非思考者”的社会分布。

**要点总结**：
1. **AI与写作的未来**：技术发展尤其是AI的进步降低了写作的门槛，使得人类更普遍地依赖人工智能完成文字工作，从而导致写作能力的淹没和分化现象。
2. **分众化的社会**：社会将划分成两个群体——“写作者”和“不写作者”。前者的范畴相对有限，更多依赖对写作的热爱或专业需求，而后者的范畴则是那些因技术替代而丧失或不愿发展写作技能的人群。
3. **思考与写作的联系**：作者强调，写作不仅是文字上的表达，更是对思维的锻炼。遗忘写作的技能意味着放弃了一种有力的思考方式，这可能导致知识的传播和理解方式发生改变。
4. **技能消失的担忧**：随着技术替代，人们对与否写作的抉择可能变得更个人化和主动化，类似于技术进步导致的其他专业技能的消失。但这种状况不仅仅是技术替代的问题，它反映了个人选择对社会技能分布的影响。
5. **主动选择与社会分层**：类似工业革命后出现的体力劳动者群体分化，未来社会的分化可能更多依赖于个人对自身技能的主动选择和追求。虽然个体仍有机会通过个人努力成为“写作者”，但社会整体上可能面临思考品质和写作技能水平的不均等化问题。

One of the strangest things you learn if you're a writer is how many people have trouble writing. Doctors know how many people have a mole they're worried about; people who are good at setting up computers know how many people aren't; writers know how many people need help writing.

The reason so many people have trouble writing is that it's fundamentally difficult. To write well you have to think clearly, and thinking clearly is hard.

And yet writing pervades many jobs, and the more prestigious the job, the more writing it tends to require.

These two powerful opposing forces, the pervasive expectation of writing and the irreducible difficulty of doing it, create enormous pressure. This is why eminent professors often turn out to have resorted to plagiarism. The most striking thing to me about these cases is the pettiness of the thefts. The stuff they steal is usually the most mundane boilerplate — the sort of thing that anyone who was even halfway decent at writing could turn out with no effort at all. Which means they're not even halfway decent at writing.

Till recently there was no convenient escape valve for the pressure created by these opposing forces. You could pay someone to write for you, like JFK, or plagiarize, like MLK, but if you couldn't buy or steal words, you had to write them yourself. And as a result nearly everyone who was expected to write had to learn how.

Not anymore. AI has blown this world open. Almost all pressure to write has dissipated. You can have AI do it for you, both in school and at work.

The result will be a world divided into writes and write-nots. There will still be some people who can write. Some of us like it. But the middle ground between those who are good at writing and those who can't write at all will disappear. Instead of good writers, ok writers, and people who can't write, there will just be good writers and people who can't write.

Is that so bad? Isn't it common for skills to disappear when technology makes them obsolete? There aren't many blacksmiths left, and it doesn't seem to be a problem.

Yes, it's bad. The reason is something I mentioned earlier: writing is thinking. In fact there's a kind of thinking that can only be done by writing. You can't make this point better than Leslie Lamport did:

> If you're thinking without writing, you only think you're thinking.

So a world divided into writes and write-nots is more dangerous than it sounds. It will be a world of thinks and think-nots. I know which half I want to be in, and I bet you do too.This situation is not unprecedented. In preindustrial times most people's jobs made them strong. Now if you want to be strong, you work out. So there are still strong people, but only those who choose to be.

It will be the same with writing. There will still be smart people, but only those who choose to be.
