## Summary
**摘要**：
本文作者Bryan针对在购买域名之前进行的一个疏忽——未检查域名过往的历史信息，导致购买的`musicbox.fun`域名被归为“鬼域名”。该域名拥有盗版音乐的历史，被搜索引擎误判为并被列入版权侵犯黑名单。意味着当前虽已完成所有权转移，但域名声誉已受损，再借此发布内容很难获得较高的搜索引擎排名。为解决该问题，作者提供了以下几点思路和方法。

**要点总结**：

1. **识别“鬼域名”**：通过访问Wayback Machine、搜索DMCA报告或使用SEO工具检测历史SEO数据，检查域名是否拥有非法或可疑的历史信息；警觉非寻常的遗留内容或大量的版权违规警告。

2. **搜索相关投诉与法律行动**：利用Google Transparency Report查找申诉记录、使用lumendatabase. org搜索版权投诉，对于发现的任何版权投诉都应给予高度重视。

3. **网站状况及结果的恢复**：搜索业务搜索引擎索引状况及业务日志，评估是否需要对网站进行技术优化或搜索引擎营销，通过创建高质量内容、构建更多外链及持续优化网站加载速度等方式提高网站权重。

4. **与搜索引擎对话与申诉**：使用搜索引擎特有管理流程如Google Search Console和Bing Webmaster Tools反映问题，并密切关注是否有显著改善，不建议对过去有效的合理版权投诉提交错误申诉。

5. **采取最佳实践**：重申SEO基础策略的重要性，确保网站品质、结构化内容、可用性、快速响应及高质量外部链接，重新确立网站的正面声誉和信任度，达到恢复搜索排名并吸引流量的目的。

**总结：** 在购买域名之前进行彻底的历史调查对于避免其存在的潜在问题至关重要，特别是避免经受过版权投诉或有其他不良历史的域名。通过应用上述策略与最佳实践，即使面对“鬼域名”的挑战，仍有望恢复网站排名并吸引更多流量。

Markdown Content:
In mid-2022 I bought a new domain name.

The name was `musicbox.fun`. I got it for a side-project, an [interactive online music box](https://musicbox.fun/) that I had built and hosted at `musicboxfun.com`. The new name was shorter and more quirky. I felt lucky to have grabbed it.

Unfortunately, `musicbox.fun` had a history. Before I bought it, the domain was used to host pirated music.

![Image 1: A screenshot of musicbox.fun as it existed in 2018, before I owned it](https://www.bryanbraun.com/assets/images/old-music-box-fun.png)

`musicbox.fun`, as it existed in 2018 (before I owned it)

From June 2018 to February 2021, the site racked up thousands of copyright violation complaints. Over 20,000 of its urls were delisted by Google (and other search engines) before the site went offline in 2022.

I had no idea, of course. It wasn’t until I had redirected all of my `musicboxfun.com` traffic to `musicbox.fun` that I noticed that something wasn’t right: my web traffic from organic search dropped to zero.

I assumed it was temporary so I double-checked my process and waited for awhile, but it never really recovered. It wasn’t until a year later that I discovered the copyright violations and learned that the domain name was compromised.

Apparently, this is a thing that happens to domain names, but as far as I know, there’s not really a name for it. When I described it to my wife, she said _“Oh, so it’s haunted.”_

“Haunted” is the perfect word for this:

*   Something terrible happened at the domain name in the past.
*   On the surface, nothing seems wrong with the domain name.
*   Then there are signs that something isn’t right.
*   Obligatory jump-scare when you discover what happened.
*   Internal debate: do you abandon it or try to fix it?
*   There’s a ton of superstition around how to fix it.
*   Superficial fixes don’t seem to work.

When there's something strange with your domain name, who you gonna call?

So to summarize, I’m saying a domain name is “haunted” when something in its past gives it a poor reputation among search engines, affecting its ability to rank in search results, even after it changes ownership.

The inner-workings of search engines are notoriously opaque\*, making it difficult to 1) know if you’re being affected and 2) know how to fix it. The following are my suggestions, based on my experience with `musicbox.fun`.

How to check if a domain name is haunted[](https://www.bryanbraun.com/2024/10/25/before-you-buy-a-domain-name-first-check-to-see-if-its-haunted/#how-to-check-if-a-domain-name-is-haunted)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Before you buy a domain name, there’s a few ways to check if it’s haunted:

### 1\. Check the Wayback Machine at archive.org[](https://www.bryanbraun.com/2024/10/25/before-you-buy-a-domain-name-first-check-to-see-if-its-haunted/#1-check-the-wayback-machine-at-archiveorg)

If you go to [web.archive.org](https://web.archive.org/) and put in your domain name, it will pull up archived web pages of whatever lived at the domain in the past. Here’s a couple things to look out for:

1.  Does anything in the past look illegal or sketchy (piracy, gambling, porn, etc)?
2.  Is the history suspiciously empty?
    *   If so, then possibly the past content was [removed by request](https://help.archive.org/help/how-do-i-request-to-remove-something-from-archive-org-2/) (I suspect this was the case for `musicbox.fun`)

### 2\. Search DMCA complaints[](https://www.bryanbraun.com/2024/10/25/before-you-buy-a-domain-name-first-check-to-see-if-its-haunted/#2-search-dmca-complaints)

DMCA stands for “Digital Millenium Copyright Act,” which is a US law that enables people to report copyright infractions to search engine companies (among other things). These reports are public, and you can look them up in a few ways:

1.  Search [Google Transparency Report](https://transparencyreport.google.com/) for your domain, to find delist requests (you can [see the report for musicbox.fun here](https://transparencyreport.google.com/copyright/domains/musicbox.fun)).
2.  Search [lumendatabase.org](https://lumendatabase.org/) for your domain, to find copyright complaints (for an example, see [these results for musicbox.fun](https://lumendatabase.org/notices/search?term=%22https%3A%2F%2Fmusicbox.fun%22&term-exact-search=true&sort_by=)).

Finding ANY copyright complaints for your domain is cause for concern, especially if there are a lot of them and they were filed recently.

### 3\. Search historical SEO data[](https://www.bryanbraun.com/2024/10/25/before-you-buy-a-domain-name-first-check-to-see-if-its-haunted/#3-search-historical-seo-data)

If you’re considering buying an important domain name, you may also want to search historical SEO data. Advanced SEO tools like [ahrefs.com](https://ahrefs.com/) can give you detailed information about backlinks, ranking history, and estimates for traffic and domain authority. Often, you’ll need to pay to get full access to this kind of data.

Interpreting this data is beyond the scope of this post, but a bit of research can help uncover problems here.

Ok, it’s haunted. Now what do I do?[](https://www.bryanbraun.com/2024/10/25/before-you-buy-a-domain-name-first-check-to-see-if-its-haunted/#ok-its-haunted-now-what-do-i-do)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 1\. Talk to the search engines[](https://www.bryanbraun.com/2024/10/25/before-you-buy-a-domain-name-first-check-to-see-if-its-haunted/#1-talk-to-the-search-engines)

Many search engines have tools for domain owners, like [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console) and [Bing Webmaster Tools](https://www.bing.com/webmasters). Definitely set up a profile and get your domain name added. It can help surface past issues and it gives you a way to report when issues have been resolved. For more details about specific actions you can take here, see [my stackexchange post](https://webmasters.stackexchange.com/a/145283/36576) on the topic.

If your domain has DMCA complaints, you may be tempted to file a [DMCA counter-notice](https://support.google.com/legal/troubleshooter/1114905?rd=2&sjid=13861243148551035047-NC#ts=9814647%2C1115655%2C13630207%2C12999302%2C9814950%2C1115791). Don’t do it. Counter-notices are for _errorneous_ copyright complaints, not complaints that were once valid but no longer relevant. Per Google’s counter-notice submission form:

> Please note: If the content on the page was infringing at the time the original removal request arrived, your counter notice is not legally valid. Do not submit a counter notice if there was illegal content, even if it’s now been removed.

As far as I can tell, there’s not really anything you can do to make past, valid DCMA complaints go away.

### 2\. Double-down on best practices[](https://www.bryanbraun.com/2024/10/25/before-you-buy-a-domain-name-first-check-to-see-if-its-haunted/#2-double-down-on-best-practices)

My SEO strategy has always been to do great work and make it easy for Google to see it. It usually works pretty well (at least for my non-haunted domains). For haunted domains, you have a bad reputation to overturn, which seems to require extra vigilence. SEO basics, like high-quality, structured, accessible, content on a fast-loading site, are table stakes.

If you’ve done any SEO work, you know that search engines treat links to your site as a massive signal of relevance and trust. I suspect that fresh incoming links are especially important for overturning a bad reputation, though I haven’t confirmed this personally. If you think `musicbox.fun` is a useful project and you wield [the power of a link](https://www.bryanbraun.com/2020/10/03/the-power-of-a-link/), consider posting a link to it, and maybe we’ll find out together.

### 3\. Wait for a while?[](https://www.bryanbraun.com/2024/10/25/before-you-buy-a-domain-name-first-check-to-see-if-its-haunted/#3-wait-for-a-while)

In my research I found [a detailed stackexchange post about trust scores and how they are affected by DMCA complaints](https://webmasters.stackexchange.com/a/99701/36576). This post suggested that recovery could take some time:

> It takes years to rebuild trust scores and for some sites, this may never happen. …the reality is that a domain can ruin its value beyond redemption.

This post isn’t a primary source, but I also came across an Q&A with a Google Search employee who fielded a similar question about DMCA violations. Their response said something similar, basically, that it can take time for the reputation effects to wear off (I’m struggling to find the video now, but I’ll link it when I do).

All of this is fairly disappointing. In a perfect world, when your legitimately good content isn’t being surfaced by Google, it’s a failure on **their** part, and **their** problem to solve, not yours. In practice, it is **your** problem and you have to do a bunch of work to help them see that their current assessment of your domain name is no longer accurate.

Ideally, search engine algorithms would give new domain owners a fresh start. Yes, it would prevent “haunted domain issues” but it would also reduce [squatting on trusted domains](https://macwright.com/2024/10/16/domain-second-thoughts) (another issue I’ve been burned by). Unfortunately, we don’t live in that world\*, so we only have a few options:

1.  Avoid buying haunted domain names
2.  Abandon domain names, once you discover that they are haunted
3.  Put in a bunch of time and effort to restore a haunted domain name’s low trust score

For `musicbox.fun`, I want to at least _try_ #3. I’ve taken some of the steps above and it feels like I’m starting to see progress. It’s slow, but I’m not in a big hurry to restore traffic. The site is just a hobby and it was always a niche project for a niche audience.

Either way, I hope to post an update in a while to let you know if it improves over time.

* * *

\* It’s easy to attribute issues like these to anti-competitive behavior or some other malicious cause, but I don’t blame Google here. If their reputation algorithm was more transparent (or forgiving), it could be more easily exploited by bad actors. Obscurity prevents exploitation but also adds to the mystery and superstition that plagues the SEO industry. It’s tempting to get sucked into the mystery, trying to figure out the algorithm despite its constant changes and intentional obscurity, but that’s not how I want to live my life.
