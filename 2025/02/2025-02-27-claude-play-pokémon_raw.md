A few researchers at Anthropic have, over the past year, had a part-time obsession with a peculiar problem.

Can Claude play Pokémon?

A thread:

Early attempts were poor. In June 2024, Claude 3.5 Sonnet struggled to progress. When challenged, it repeatedly tried to run from mandatory battles.

This wasn't surprising: Claude has never been explicitly trained to play any video games.

These early attempts were not without moments of levity too.

On one occasion, Claude got stuck in a corner and—convinced something must be broken—typed out a formal request to reset the game.

With the new Claude 3.5 Sonnet in October, there was a glimmer of improvement. Claude managed to beat a rival for the first time and move beyond Pallet Town.

But ultimately, progress stalled. Better, yes, but far from becoming a Pokémon master.

Last week, a researcher tried out an early preview of Claude 3.7 Sonnet.

The results were striking. Within hours, Claude defeated Brock. Days later, it trounced Misty. Progress that older models had little hope of achieving.

Turns out extended thinking is super effective.

Where previous models wandered aimlessly or got stuck in loops, Claude 3.7 Sonnet plans ahead, remembers its objectives, and adapts when initial strategies fail.

Critical skills for battling pixelated gym leaders. And, we posit, in solving real-world problems too.

So, what makes this possible? Claude was given a knowledge base to store notes, vision to see the screen, and function calls which allow it to simulate button presses and navigate the game.

Together, they allow Claude to sustain gameplay with tens of thousands of interactions.

With a few tools to help it see the screen a bit better, Claude acts as an agent, applying its abilities to a novel task.

In this, we start to see glimmers of AI systems that tackle challenges with increasing competence, not just through training but with generalized reasoning.

A small but enthusiastic following has formed at Anthropic, checking in on Claude's progress.

Claude provides its followers daily moments of delight, like deciding to misname its Squirtle, "TSUNMAI!"

Claude Plays Pokémon continues on as a researcher's personal project.

And for those curious about Claude's improved reasoning capabilities, we go into even more detail in this thread:

Some things come to us nearly instantly. Others take much more mental stamina. We can choose to apply more or less cognitive effort depending on the task at hand.

Now, Claude has that same flexibility.
