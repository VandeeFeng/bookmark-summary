Title: Why Blog If Nobody Reads It?

Back in the day, advertising legend Bill Bernbach said, “The most powerful element in advertising is the truth.”

Let’s tell the truth, then: Nobody reads your blog.

At least, not as many as you’d like. Maybe a handful, maybe none. You pour your thoughts into it, craft each sentence, pick the right image — then silence. No likes, no shares, no engagement.

So what’s the point?

There’s two lies we tell ourselves:

1.  _If I write it, they will come._ They won’t. There are billions of blog posts out there. The internet is an infinite void, and your blog is a whisper in a hurricane.
2.  If nobody reads it, it’s a waste of time.

Is it, though?

There is a hidden value in blogging. There’s an old Zen saying: “Chop wood, carry water.” You do it not for the applause but because it needs doing.

Blogging forces clarity. It makes you structure your thoughts, sharpen your perspective. You stop writing fluff because — let’s be honest — you’re writing for yourself. And if you can’t keep yourself interested, nobody else stands a chance.

When you write, you think better. When you think better, you create better.

So, who’s there real audience?

You’re not just writing for today’s invisible audience. You’re writing for:

*   Future you. Your posts become a time capsule of your evolving mind.
*   One right person. Maybe one day, someone stumbles across your words at exactly the right moment. And that changes something for them.
*   The work itself. Consistency beats virality. A hundred posts with depth will outlast a single viral hit.

And there’s another thing. My other passion is street photography. Which is a bit like blogging.

You walk through the city, camera in hand. You see a scene — a moment of light, shadow, humanity. You capture it.

Nobody cares.

But that’s not why you did it. You did it because you saw something.

Like blogging. You write because you think, because you observe, because you need to put it somewhere.

If someone reads it? Bonus. If not? The work still got done.

And that’s the real point.
